# Physical and Chemical Changes
There are two types of properties
**Physical Properties** - Can be observed without changing the identity and composition of the substance
**Chemical Properties** - Describe the way a substance may change, or react, to form other substances
One common chemical property is flammability or the ability to burn in the presence of oxygen
**Intensive Properties** - Do not depend on the amount of sample being examined
(temperature and melting point)
**Extensive Properties** - Depend on the amount of sample
(mass and volume)
When a substance undergoes change it does so in two ways
**Physical Change** - A substance changes its physical appearance but not its composition
The evaporation of water is one such change
**Chemical Change** - a substance is transformed into a chemically different substance
$H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow H_2 O$ is one chemical change

# Separation of Mixtures
Separating a mixture into its components can be done depending on the differences in the parts properties
We can also take advantage of chemical differences

One way to separate a solid and a liquid is through filtration

One way to separate a liquid and a liquid is via distillation

Another way to separate two liquids is chromatography
