To say the length of a pencil is 17.5 means nothing. Expressing it with its units properly specifies the length 17.5cm
The units used for science are called the metric system
The preferred units are called SI units
This system has 7 base units

| **Physical Quantity** | **Name of Unit** |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Mass                  | Kilogram         |
| Length                | Meter            |
| Time                  | Second           |
| Temperature           | Kelvin           |
| Amount of a Substance | Mole             |
| Electric Current      | Ampere           |
| Luminous Intensity    | Candela          |
There are also prefixes which can be added to any root name of a unit these are

| Prefix | Meaning    |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Peta   | $10^{15}$  |
| Tera   | $10^{12}$  |
| Giga   | $10^{9}$   |
| Mega   | $10^{6}$   |
| Kilo   | $10^{3}$   |
| Deci   | $10^{-1}$  |
| Centi  | $10^{-2}$  |
| Milli  | $10^{-3}$  |
| Micro  | $10^{-6}$  |
| Nano   | $10^{-9}$  |
| Pico   | $10^{-12}$ |
| Femto  | $10^{-15}$ |
| Atto   | $10^{-18}$ |
| Zepto  | $10^{-21}$ |
## Length and Mass
The base unit for length is the meter which is slightly longer than a yard
The base unit for mass is the kilogram which is about 2.2 pounds (We add all the prefixes to gram)
## Temperature
**Temperature** - A measure of the hotness or coldness of an object, is a physical property
that determines the direction of heat flow
The base unit is Kelvin $$K=\degree C + 273.15$$
Also note we do not use a degree sign with kelvin just the K

# Derived SI Units
for example speed is defined as distance over time and as such its SI unit is $m/s$ or meters per second
Another example is volume. The volume of a cube is $(length)^3$ thus the derived unit is $m^3$ or meters cubed
There are 3 types of devices we use in chemistry to control the volume of a testing material. The devices that deliver variable volumes, the pipet which delivers a specific volume and the volumetric flask which contains a specific volume

## Density
$$Density = \frac{mass}{volume}$$
Most densities of solids and liquids in chemistry are either expressed in $g/cm^3$ or $g/mL^3$ it is not a coincidence that water has a density of $1g/cm^3$  because this is how the gram was initially defined. If no temperature is reported we assume that density is valid at $25\degree C$.
