**Dimensional Analysis** - In this approach, units are multiplied together, divided into each other, or “canceled”
You use dimensional analysis as follows$$3in\cdot\frac{2.54cm}{1in}=7.62cm$$
**Conversion Factor** - fraction whose numerator and denominator are the same quantity expressed in different units
In the above example a conversion factor is $$\frac{2.54cm}{1in}$$
# Using Two or More Conversion Factors
One example is when you want to convert a 8m rod into inches you would do so as follows$$8m\cdot\frac{1cm}{10^{-2}m}\cdot\frac{1in}{2.54cm}=315in$$
# Conversions Involving Volume
The density of a substance can act as a conversion factor between mass and volume for example$$2in^3\cdot\frac{(2.54)^3cm^3}{(1)^3in^3}\cdot\frac{19.3g}{1cm^3}=633g$$
