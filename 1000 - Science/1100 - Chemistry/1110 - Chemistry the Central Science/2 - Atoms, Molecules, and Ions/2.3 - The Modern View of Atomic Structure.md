There are many more subatomic particles than just electrons, protons, and neutrons however these are the only 3 which have an affect on chemical reactions so we just focus on them
As noted earlier the charge of a proton and electron has and absolute value of $1.602\times10^{-19}C$ this is called the **electronic charge** 
For convenience the charges of atomic and subatomic particles are given in multiples of this charge instead of coulombs
Atoms have small masses so we the AMU **(Atomic Mass Unit)** where $1amu=1.66054\times10^{-24}g$ similarly we use the **Angstrom** ($Å$) where $1Å=1\times10^{-10}m$ 

# Atomic Numbers, Mass Numbers, and Isotopes
The difference between the different elements is its characteristic number of protons. The number of protons in an element is that elements **atomic number** 
Because an atom has no net electric charge it must have the same amount of electrons to balance the charge
Atoms of a given element can differ in the amount of neutrons they contain and this can change their mass. These are called **Isotopes** they are written like this $^{12}C$ where the 12 represents the total amount of particles in the atoms nucleus
