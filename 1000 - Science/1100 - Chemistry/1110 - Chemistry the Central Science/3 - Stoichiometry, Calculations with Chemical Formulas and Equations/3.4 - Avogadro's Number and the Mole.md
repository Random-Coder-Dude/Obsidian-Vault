Because we handle amounts of substances with a vast amounts of atoms we need a system to handle these large numbers
In chemistry the counting unit for numbers of atoms, ions, or molecules in a laboratory size sample is the **mole**, it is abbreviated as mol in dimensional analysis
One mole basically means we have a **Avogadro's number** of atoms in our sample
Avogadro's number is defined as the number of atoms in exactly 12g of isotopically pure $\ce{^12C}$. This number is $6.0221421\cdot10^{23}$ which chemists round to $6.022\cdot10^{23}$ 
To demonstrate moles we have$$\begin{align}
1\text{ mol }^{12}C\text{ atoms }&=6.02\times10^{23}\ \ce{^12C}\text{ atoms} \\
1\text{ mol }H_2O\text{ molecules }&=6.02\times10^{23}H_2O\text{ molecules} \\
1\text{ mol }NO_3^-\text{ ions }&=6.02\times10^{23}NO_3^-\text{ ions}
\end{align}$$
