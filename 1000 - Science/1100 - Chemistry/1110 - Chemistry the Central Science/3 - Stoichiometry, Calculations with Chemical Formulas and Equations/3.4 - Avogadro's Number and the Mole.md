Because we handle amounts of substances with a vast amounts of atoms we need a system to handle these large numbers
In chemistry the counting unit for numbers of atoms, ions, or molecules in a laboratory size sample is the **mole**, it is abbreviated as mol in dimensional analysis
One mole basically means we have a **Avogadro's number** of atoms in our sample
Avogadro's number is defined as the number of atoms in exactly 12g of isotopically pure $\ce{^12C}$. This number is $6.0221421\cdot10^{23}$ which chemists round to $6.022\cdot10^{23}$ 
To demonstrate moles we have$$\begin{align}
1\text{ mol }^{12}C\text{ atoms }&=6.02\times10^{23}\ \ce{^12C}\text{ atoms} \\
1\text{ mol }H_2O\text{ molecules }&=6.02\times10^{23}H_2O\text{ molecules} \\
1\text{ mol }NO_3^-\text{ ions }&=6.02\times10^{23}NO_3^-\text{ ions}
\end{align}$$
# Molar Mass
A dozen is the same number (12) no matter what the object is similarly a mole is always the same number but it can have a different mass
This leads to a important rule **The atomic weight of an element in atomic mass units is numerically equal to the mass in grams of 1 mol of that element**
$H_2O$ has a formula weight of 18.0 amu so 1 mol of $H_2O$ has a mass of 18.0g
Its that simple

# Interconverting Masses and Moles
## Grams to Moles
You have 36.0g of water ($H_2O$) how many moles of water do you have?
First you find the molar mass of water $$\begin{align}
M_{H_2O}&=2(1.008)+15.999\ g/mol \\
M_{H_2O}&=18.015\ g/mol \\
n_{H_2O}&=36.0g\cdot\frac{1\text{ mol}}{18.105\text{ g}} \\
n_{H_2O}&=2.00\text{ mol}
\end{align}$$
Remember significant figures

## Moles to Grams
Calculate the mass, in grams, of 0.433 mol of calcium nitrate
First we find the molar mass of calcium nitrate ($Ca(NO_3)_2$)
$$\begin{align}
M_{Ca(NO_3)_2}&=40.078+2(14.007+3(15.999))\text{}g/mol \\
M_{Ca(NO_3)_2}&=164.086\ g/mol \\
n_{Ca(NO_3)_2}&=0.433\text{ mol}\cdot\frac{164.086\text{ g}}{1\text{ mol}} \\
n_{Ca(NO_3)_2}&=71\text{ g}
\end{align}$$
