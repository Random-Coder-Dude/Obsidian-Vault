Because we handle amounts of substances with a vast amounts of atoms we need a system to handle these large numbers
In chemistry the counting unit for numbers of atoms, ions, or molecules in a laboratory size sample is the **mole**, it is abbreviated as mol in dimensional analysis
One mole basically means we have a **Avogadro's number** of atoms in our sample
Avogadro's number is defined as the number of atoms in exactly 12g of isotopically pure $\ce{^12C}$. This number is $6.0221421\cdot10^{23}$ which chemists round to $6.022\cdot10^{23}$ 
To demonstrate moles we have
$$
\begin{align}
1~\ce{mol ^12C} &= 6.02\times10^{23}~\ce{^12C atoms} \\
1~\ce{mol H2O} &= 6.02\times10^{23}~\ce{H2O molecules} \\
1~\ce{mol NO3^-} &= 6.02\times10^{23}~\ce{NO3^- ions}
\end{align}
$$
# Molar Mass
A dozen is the same number (12) no matter what the object is similarly a mole is always the same number but it can have a different mass
This leads to a important rule **The atomic weight of an element in atomic mass units is numerically equal to the mass in grams of 1 mol of that element**
$H_2O$ has a formula weight of 18.0 amu so 1 mol of $H_2O$ has a mass of 18.0g
Its that simple

# Interconverting Masses and Moles
## Grams to Moles
You have 36.0g of water ($H_2O$) how many moles of water do you have?
First you find the molar mass of water 
$$
\begin{align}
M_{\ce{H2O}} &= 2(1.008) + 15.999~\text{g/mol} \\
M_{\ce{H2O}} &= 18.015~\text{g/mol} \\
n_{\ce{H2O}} &= 36.0~\text{g} \cdot \frac{1~\text{mol}}{18.015~\text{g}} \\
n_{\ce{H2O}} &= 2.00~\text{mol}
\end{align}
$$

Remember significant figures
## Moles to Grams
Calculate the mass, in grams, of 0.433 mol of calcium nitrate
First we find the molar mass of calcium nitrate ($Ca(NO_3)_2$)
$$
\begin{align}
M_{\ce{Ca(NO3)2}} &= 40.078 + 2(14.007 + 3(15.999))~\text{g/mol} \\
M_{\ce{Ca(NO3)2}} &= 164.086~\text{g/mol} \\
m_{\ce{Ca(NO3)2}} &= 0.433~\text{mol} \cdot \frac{164.086~\text{g}}{1~\text{mol}} \\
m_{\ce{Ca(NO3)2}} &= 71.0~\text{g}
\end{align}
$$
# Interconverting Masses and Numbers of Particles
letâ€™s calculate the number of copper atoms in an old copper penny. Such a penny has a mass of about 3 g, and we assume it is 100% copper. The math would follow like this
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Cu atoms} &= 3~\text{g~Cu} \cdot \frac{1~\text{mol~Cu}}{63.546~\text{g~Cu}} \cdot \frac{6.022\times10^{23}~\ce{Cu~atoms}}{1~\text{mol~Cu}} \\
\text{Cu atoms} &= 2.84 \times 10^{22}~\ce{Cu~atoms}
\end{align}
$$
