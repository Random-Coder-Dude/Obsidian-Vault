The empirical formula for a substance tells us the relative number of atoms of each element in the substance.
For example water has the empirical formula ($H_2O$). This ratio applies to the moles as well. 1 mol of water contains 2 mol of hydrogen and 1 mol of oxygen
Thus the mole allows us to calculate empirical formulas
For example
Mercury and chlorine form a compound that is 73.9% mercury and 26.1% chlorine by mass. What is empirical formula for this compound?
You would solve it like so
Assuming a 100g sample we have 73.9g mercury and 26.1g chlorine
$$\begin{align}
n_{Hg}&=73.9\text{ g }Hg\cdot\frac{1\text{ mol }Hg}{200.59\text{ g }Hg} \\
n_{Hg}&=0.368\text{ mol }Hg \\
n_{Cl}&=26.1\text{ g }Cl\cdot\frac{1\text{ mol }Cl}{35.45\text{ g }Cl} \\
n_{Cl}&=0.736\text{ mol }Cl
\end{align}$$
To get the empirical ratio we continue as follows
$$\frac{\text{moles of }Cl}{\text{moles of }Hg}=\frac{0.736\text{ mol }Cl}{0.368\text{ mol }Hg}=\frac{2\text{ mol }Cl}{1\text{ mol }Hg}$$
So we can confidently say the
