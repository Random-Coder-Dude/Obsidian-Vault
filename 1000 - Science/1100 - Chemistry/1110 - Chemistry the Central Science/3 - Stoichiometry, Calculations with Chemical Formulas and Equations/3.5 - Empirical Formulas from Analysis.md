The empirical formula for a substance tells us the relative number of atoms of each element in the substance.
For example water has the empirical formula ($H_2O$). This ratio applies to the moles as well. 1 mol of water contains 2 mol of hydrogen and 1 mol of oxygen
Thus the mole allows us to calculate empirical formulas
For example
Mercury and chlorine form a compound that is 73.9% mercury and 26.1% chlorine by mass. What is empirical formula for this compound?
You would solve it like so
Assuming a 100g sample we have 73.9g mercury and 26.1g chlorine
$$\begin{align}
n_{Hg}&=73.9\text{ g }Hg\cdot\frac{1\text{ mol }Hg}{200.59\text{ g }Hg} \\
n_{Hg}&=0.368\text{ mol }Hg \\
n_{Cl}&=26.1\text{ g }Cl\cdot\frac{1\text{ mol }Cl}{35.45\text{ g }Cl} \\
n_{Cl}&=0.736\text{ mol }Cl
\end{align}$$
To get the empirical ratio we continue as follows
$$\frac{\text{moles of }Cl}{\text{moles of }Hg}=\frac{0.736\text{ mol }Cl}{0.368\text{ mol }Hg}=\frac{2\text{ mol }Cl}{1\text{ mol }Hg}$$
So we can confidently say the empirical formula for this compound is $HgCl_2$

# Molecular Formulas from Empirical Formulas
To convert between the two different types of formulas we can use the handy$$\text{Whole number multiple}=\frac{\text{molecular weight}}{\text{empirical formula weight}}$$
For example if we have an empirical formula with a weight of 88 amu ($C_3H_4O_3$) and we know the molecular weight is 176 amu we can than find the molecular formula by$$2=\frac{176\text{ amu}}{88\text{ amu}}$$
so we multiply all of the subscripts by 2 and get the molecular formula ($C_6H_8O_6$)

# Combustion Analysis
One technique for determining empirical formulas in the laboratory is **combustion analysis**, commonly used for compounds containing principally carbon and hydrogen

The amounts of CO2 and H2O produced are determined by measuring the mass increase in the CO2 and H2O absorbers. From the masses of CO2 and H2O we can calculate the number of moles of C and H in the original sample and thereby the empirical formula. If a third element is present in the compound, its mass can be determined by subtracting the measured masses of C and H from the original sample mass
