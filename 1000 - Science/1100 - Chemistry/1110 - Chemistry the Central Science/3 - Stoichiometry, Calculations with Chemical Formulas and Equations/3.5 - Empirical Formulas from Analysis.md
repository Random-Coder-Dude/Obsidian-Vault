The empirical formula for a substance tells us the relative number of atoms of each element in the substance.  
For example, water has the empirical formula ($\ce{H2O}$). This ratio applies to the moles as well: 1 mol of water contains 2 mol of hydrogen and 1 mol of oxygen.  

Thus the mole allows us to calculate empirical formulas.  

For example:  
Mercury and chlorine form a compound that is 73.9% mercury and 26.1% chlorine by mass. What is the empirical formula for this compound?  

Assuming a 100 g sample, we have 73.9 g mercury and 26.1 g chlorine:

$$
\begin{align}
n_{\ce{Hg}} &= 73.9~\text{g} \cdot \frac{1~\text{mol~Hg}}{200.59~\text{g~Hg}} \\
n_{\ce{Hg}} &= 0.368~\text{mol~Hg} \\
n_{\ce{Cl}} &= 26.1~\text{g} \cdot \frac{1~\text{mol~Cl}}{35.45~\text{g~Cl}} \\
n_{\ce{Cl}} &= 0.736~\text{mol~Cl}
\end{align}
$$

To get the empirical ratio:

$$
\frac{\text{moles of } \ce{Cl}}{\text{moles of } \ce{Hg}}
=
\frac{0.736~\text{mol~Cl}}{0.368~\text{mol~Hg}}
=
\frac{2~\text{mol~Cl}}{1~\text{mol~Hg}}
$$

So we can confidently say the empirical formula for this compound is $\ce{HgCl2}$.

# Molecular Formulas from Empirical Formulas

To convert between the two different types of formulas we can use the handy formula:

$$
\text{Whole~number~multiple} = 
\frac{\text{molecular~weight}}{\text{empirical~formula~weight}}
$$

For example, if we have an empirical formula with a weight of 88 amu ($\ce{C3H4O3}$) and we know the molecular weight is 176 amu, we can then find the molecular formula by:

$$
2 = \frac{176~\text{amu}}{88~\text{amu}}
$$

So we multiply all of the subscripts by 2 and get the molecular formula ($\ce{C6H8O6}$).
# Combustion Analysis

One technique for determining empirical formulas in the laboratory is **combustion analysis**, commonly used for compounds containing principally carbon and hydrogen.

The amounts of $\ce{CO2}$ and $\ce{H2O}$ produced are determined by measuring the mass increase in the CO2 and H2O absorbers. From the masses of $\ce{CO2}$ and $\ce{H2O}$ we can calculate the number of moles of C and H in the original sample and thereby the empirical formula.  

If a third element is present in the compound, its mass can be determined by subtracting the measured masses of C and H from the original sample mass.
