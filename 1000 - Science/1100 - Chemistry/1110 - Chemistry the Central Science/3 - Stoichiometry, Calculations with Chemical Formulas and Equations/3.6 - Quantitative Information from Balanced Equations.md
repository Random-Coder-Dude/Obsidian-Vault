The mole concept allows us to convert this information to the masses of the substances in the reaction. For instance$$2H_2(g)+O_2(g)\ce{->}2H_2O(l)$$
Tells us that two moles of diatomic hydrogen reacting with 1 mole of diatomic oxygen will form 2 moles of water
Basically the coefficients tell us the mol ratios in a chemical equation
These are called **stoichiometrically equivalent quantities**
we can denote them with $\bumpeq$ 
For example we can use this solving when
If you have 1.57 mol of $O_2$ and infinite $H_2$ then how much water can you produce in moles
$$\begin{align}
\text{Moles }H_2O&=1.57\text{ mol }O_2\cdot\frac{2\text{ mol }H_2O}{1\text{ mol }O_2} \\
\text{Moles }H_2O&=3.14\text{ mol }H_2O
\end{align}$$
