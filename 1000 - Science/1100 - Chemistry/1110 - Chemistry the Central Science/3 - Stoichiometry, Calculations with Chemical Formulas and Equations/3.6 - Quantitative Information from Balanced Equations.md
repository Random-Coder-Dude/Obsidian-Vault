The mole concept allows us to convert this information to the masses of the substances in the reaction. For instance$$2H_2(g)+O_2(g)\ce{->}2H_2O(l)$$
Tells us that two moles of diatomic hydrogen reacting with 1 mole of diatomic oxygen will form 2 moles of water
Basically the coefficients tell us the mol ratios in a chemical equation
These are called **stoichiometrically equivalent **
