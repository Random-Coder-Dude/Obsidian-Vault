Suppose you have 10 slices of bread and 7 slices of cheese and want to know how many sandwiches you can make. Representing the chemical formula as$$2Bd+Ch\ce{->}Bd_2Ch$$
You can make 5 sandwiches where 2 slices of cheese are not used. This is the concept of **limiting reactants**. As soon as a reactant is used up the chemical reaction stops. 

# Theoretical Yields
Using this knowledge we can solve for theoretical yields of chemical reactions
For example, if we had 10 mol of $H_2$ and 7 mol of $O_2$ how many mol of $H_2O$ is theoretically possible? Because 10 mol of $H_2$ only needs 5 mol of $O_2$, Hydrogen is our limiting reactant therefore all calculations are based of the amount of hydrogen
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Moles } \ce{H2O} &= 10~\text{mol } \ce{H2} \cdot \frac{2~\text{mol } \ce{H2O}}{2~\text{mol } \ce{H2}} \\
\text{Moles } \ce{H2O} &= 10~\text{mol } \ce{H2O}
\end{align}
$$
