Suppose you have 10 slices of bread and 7 slices of cheese and want to know how many sandwiches you can make. Representing the chemical formula as$$2Bd+Ch\ce{->}Bd_2Ch$$
You can make 5 sandwiches where 2 slices of cheese are not used. This is the concept of **limiting reactants**. As soon as a reactant is used up the chemical reaction stops. Using this knowledge we can solve for theoretical yields of chemical reactions
For example, if we had 10 mol of $H_2$ and 7 mol of $O_2$ how many mol of $H_2O$ is theoretically possible? Because 10 mol of $H_2$ only needs 5 mol of $O_2
