A solution in which water is the dissolving medium is called an **aqueous solution**. In this chapter we examine chemical reactions that take place in aqueous solutions
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances
The substance present in the greatest quantity is usually called the **solvent**, and the other substances are called **solutes**; they are said to be dissolved in the solvent

# Electrolytic Properties
At a young age we learn not to bring electronics into the bathtub because water conducts electricity well. However this is not true because water is actually a poor conductor of electricity, the stuff that conducts it well just happens to be in the water
The conductivity of pure water is not sufficient to complete the electrical circuit and light the bulb. The situation changes when ions are present in solution because the ions carry electrical charge from one electrode to the other, completing the circuit. Thus, the conductivity of $NaCl$ solutions indicates the presence of ions
When $NaCl$ dissolves in water, the solution contains and ions, each surrounded by water molecules. When sucrose ($C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$) dissolves in water, the solution contains only neutral sucrose molecules surrounded by water molecules
A substance (such as $NaCl$) whose aqueous solutions contain ions is called an
**electrolyte**. A substance (such as $C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$) that does not form ions in solution is
called a **nonelectrolyte**.
