A solution in which water is the dissolving medium is called an **aqueous solution**. In this chapter we examine chemical reactions that take place in aqueous solutions
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances
The substance present in the greatest quantity is usually called the **solvent**, and the other substances are called **solutes**; they are said to be dissolved in the solvent

# Electrolytic Properties
At a young age we learn not to bring electronics into the bathtub because water conducts electricity well. However this is not true because water is actually a poor conductor of electricity, the stuff that conducts it well just happens to be in the water
The conductivity of pure water is not sufficient to complete the electrical circuit and light the bulb. The situation changes when ions are present in solution because the ions carry electrical charge from one electrode to the other, completing the circuit. Thus, the conductivity of $NaCl$ solutions indicates the presence of ions
When $NaCl$ dissolves in water, the solution contains and ions, each surrounded by water molecules. When sucrose ($C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$) dissolves in water, the solution contains only neutral sucrose molecules surrounded by water molecules
A substance (such as $NaCl$) whose aqueous solutions contain ions is called an
**electrolyte**. A substance (such as $C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$) that does not form ions in solution is
called a **nonelectrolyte**.

# Ionic Compounds in Water
When $NaCl$ dissolves in water, each ion separates from the solid structure and
disperses throughout the solution. The ionic solid dissociates into its
component ions as it dissolves
Water is a very effective solvent for ionic compounds. Although H2O is an electrically neutral molecule, the O atom is rich in electrons and has a partial negative charge, denoted by $\delta^-$. Each H atom has a partial positive charge, denoted by $\delta^+$. Cations are attracted by the negative end of H2O, and anions are attracted by the positive end
As an ionic compound dissolves, the ions become surrounded by H2O molecules. The ions are said to be **solvated**
In chemical equations it is written as $Na^+(aq)\text{ and }Cl^-(aq)$ where $(aq)$ is a abbreviation for the word aqueous
Solvation helps stabilize the ions in solution and prevents cations and anions from recombining. Furthermore, because the ions and their shells of surrounding water molecules are free to move about, the ions become dispersed uniformly throughout the solution
We can usually predict the nature of the ions in a solution of an ionic compound from the chemical name of the substance. It splits into the anion and cation that originally formed it

# Molecular Compounds in Water
When a molecular compound dissolves in water, the solution usually consists of intact molecules dispersed throughout the solution. Consequently, most molecular compounds are nonelectrolytes

# Strong and Weak Electrolytes
**Strong electrolytes** are those solutes that exist in solution completely or nearly completely as ions. Essentially all water-soluble ionic compounds (such as $NaCl$)
**Weak electrolytes** are those solutes that exist in solution mostly in the form of neutral molecules with only a small fraction in the form of ions
When a weak electrolyte, such as acetic acid, ionizes in solution, we write the reaction in the form$$CH_3COOH(aq)\ce{<=>}CH_3COO^-(aq)+H^+(aq)$$
At any given moment some $CH_3COOH$ molecules are disassociating into their ions and the ions are reattracting into $CH_3COOH$ molecules
The balance between these opposing processes determines the relative numbers of ions and neutral molecules. This balance produces a state of **chemical equilibrium** in which the relative numbers of each type of ion or molecule in the reaction are constant over time
You need only to remember that water-soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes, and ammonium ions are a exception to this rule $NH_4^+$
