Sometimes when you mix together two different compounds in water through chemical reaction they form a **precipitate**. A precipitate is when an insoluble solid formed by a reaction in solution
Precipitation reactions occur when pairs of oppositely charged ions attract each other so strongly that they form an insoluble ionic solid

# Solubility Guidelines for Ionic Compounds
The **solubility** of a substance at a given temperature is the amount of the substance that can be dissolved in a given quantity of solvent at the given temperature. In other words it is a measure of how well they can integrate together
Any substance with a solubility of $0.01\text{ mol }/\text{ L }$ will be referred to as **insoluble** 
Unfortunately, there are no rules based on simple physical properties such as ionic charge to guide us in predicting whether a particular ionic compound will be soluble
However there are guidelines
