Sometimes when you mix together two different compounds in water through chemical reaction they form a **precipitate**. A precipitate is when an insoluble solid formed by a reaction in solution
Precipitation reactions occur when pairs of oppositely charged ions attract each other so strongly that they form an insoluble ionic solid

# Solubility Guidelines for Ionic Compounds
The **solubility** of a substance at a given temperature is the amount of the substance that can be dissolved in a given quantity of solvent at the given temperature. In other words it is a measure of how well they can integrate together
Any substance with a solubility of $0.01\text{ mol }/\text{ L }$ will be referred to as **insoluble** 
Unfortunately, there are no rules based on simple physical properties such as ionic charge to guide us in predicting whether a particular ionic compound will be soluble
However there are guidelines

To predict whether a precipitate forms when we mix aqueous solutions of two strong electrolytes, we must (1) note the ions present in the reactants, (2) consider the possible cation-anion combinations, and (3) use the table above to determine if any of these combinations is insoluble

# Exchange (Metathesis) Reactions
During these reactions it is important to remember to balance the charges. Here is a worked out example in order to prove the point
If $AgNO_3$ and $KCl$ are mixed in water does a precipitate form?
Reactions in which cations and anions appear to change follow the general equation
$$AX+BY\ce{->}AY+BX$$
So these products would form$$AgNO_3(aq)+KCl(aq)\ce{->}AgCl(s)+KNO_3(aq)$$
If you notice all the charges are balanced so this is valid. Also notice that $AgCl$ is not aqueous because it has a $Ag^+$ ion in it

# Ionic Equations
Sometimes it is helpful to know whether the dissolved substances are mostly dissolved as ions or as the compound. Take the chemical formula$$Pb(NO_3)_2(aq)+2KI(aq)\ce{->}PbI_2(s)+2KNO_3(aq)$$
This is called a **molecular equation**
This same equation written as a **complete ionic equation** would look something like this
$$\begin{align}
Pb^{2+}(aq)+2NO_3^-(aq)+2K^+(aq)+&2I^-(aq)\ce{->} \\
&PbI_2(s)+2K^+(aq)+2NO_3^-(aq)
\end{align}$$
Notice the ions that appear unchanged these are called **spectator ions**, they play no direct role in the chemical equation. In fact when they are omitted from the equation the equation is now in **net ionic form**. This look like this$$Pb^{2+}(aq)+2I^-(aq)\ce{->}PbI_2(s)$$
If every ion in a complete ionic equation is a spectator ion then no reaction occurs
