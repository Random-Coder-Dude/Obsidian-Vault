Sometimes when you mix together two different compounds in water through a chemical reaction, they form a **precipitate**. A precipitate is an insoluble solid formed by a reaction in solution.  
Precipitation reactions occur when pairs of oppositely charged ions attract each other so strongly that they form an insoluble ionic solid.
# Solubility Guidelines for Ionic Compounds

The **solubility** of a substance at a given temperature is the amount of the substance that can be dissolved in a given quantity of solvent at that temperature. In other words, it is a measure of how well they can integrate together.  
Any substance with a solubility of $0.01~\text{mol}/\text{L}$ will be referred to as **insoluble**.  
Unfortunately, there are no rules based on simple physical properties such as ionic charge to guide us in predicting whether a particular ionic compound will be soluble. However, there are **guidelines**:

To predict whether a precipitate forms when we mix aqueous solutions of two strong electrolytes, we must:  
1. Note the ions present in the reactants.  
2. Consider the possible cation-anion combinations.  
3. Use the table above to determine if any of these combinations is insoluble.
# Exchange (Metathesis) Reactions

During these reactions, it is important to remember to **balance the charges**. Here is a worked example:  
If $\ce{AgNO3}$ and $\ce{KCl}$ are mixed in water, does a precipitate form?  

Reactions in which cations and anions appear to change follow the general equation:
$$
\ce{AX + BY -> AY + BX}
$$
So these products would form:
$$
\ce{AgNO3(aq) + KCl(aq) -> AgCl(s) + KNO3(aq)}
$$

Notice all the charges are balanced, so this is valid. Also, $AgCl$ is not aqueous because it contains the $\ce{Ag+}$ ion.
# Ionic Equations

Sometimes it is helpful to know whether the dissolved substances are mostly present as ions or as the compound.  
The **molecular equation**:
$$
\ce{Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2KI(aq) -> PbI2(s) + 2KNO3(aq)}
$$
The **complete ionic equation**:
$$
\begin{align}
\ce{Pb^{2+}(aq) + 2NO3^-(aq) + 2K^+(aq) + 2I^-(aq) -> PbI2(s) + 2K^+(aq) + 2NO3^-(aq)}
\end{align}
$$
Notice the ions that appear unchanged; these are called **spectator ions**. They play no direct role in the chemical reaction.  
The **net ionic equation** (omitting spectator ions):
$$
\ce{Pb^{2+}(aq) + 2I^-(aq) -> PbI2(s)}
$$
If every ion in a complete ionic equation is a spectator ion, then **no reaction occurs**.
