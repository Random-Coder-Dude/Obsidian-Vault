# Acids
acids are substances that ionize in aqueous solution to form hydrogen ions $H^+(aq)$
Because hydrogen ions only contain a proton, acids are sometimes called proton donors
Molecules of different acids ionize to form different amounts of $H^+$ ions

# Bases
Bases are substances that accept (react with) $H^+$ ions. Bases produce hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) when they dissolve in water
Compounds that do not contain $OH^-$ ions can also be bases. For example, ammonia ($NH_3$) is a common base. When added to water, it accepts an ion from a water molecule and thereby produces an $OH^-$ ion

# Strong and Weak Acids and Bases
Acids and bases that are strong electrolytes (completely ionized in solution) are **strong acids** and **strong bases**. Those that are weak electrolytes (partly ionized) are **weak acids** and **weak bases**

| Strong Acids               | Strong Bases                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hydrochloric Acid ($HCl$)  | Group 1A metal hydroxides ($LiOH,NaOH,KOH,RbOH,CsOH$)          |
| Hydrobromic Acid ($HBr$)   | Heavy Group 2A metal hydroxides ($Ca(OH)_2,Sr(OH)_2,Ba(OH)_2$) |
| Hydroiodic Acid ($HI$)     |                                                                |
| Chloric Acid ($HClO_3$)    |                                                                |
| Perchloric Acid ($HClO_4$) |                                                                |
| Nitric Acid ($HNO_3$)      |                                                                |
| Sulfuric Acid ($H_2SO_4$)  |                                                                |

# Identifying Strong and Weak Electrolytes
we can make reasonable predictions about the electrolytic strength of a great number of water soluble substances
To classify if it is strong or weak work down this table

|               | Strong Electrolyte | Weak Electrolyte       | Nonelectrolyte      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Ionic**     | All                | None                   | None                |
| **Molecular** | Strong Acids       | Weak Acids, Weak Bases | All other compounds |
