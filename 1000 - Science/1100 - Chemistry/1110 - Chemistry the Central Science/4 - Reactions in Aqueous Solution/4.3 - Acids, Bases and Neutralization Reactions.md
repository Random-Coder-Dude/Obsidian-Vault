# Acids
acids are substances that ionize in aqueous solution to form hydrogen ions $H^+(aq)$
Because hydrogen ions only contain a proton, acids are sometimes called proton donors
Molecules of different acids ionize to form different amounts of $H^+$ ions

# Bases
Bases are substances that accept (react with) $H^+$ ions. Bases produce hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) when they dissolve in water
Compounds that do not contain $OH^-$ ions can also be bases. For example, ammonia ($NH_3$) is a common base. When added to water, it accepts an ion from a water molecule and thereby produces an $OH^-$ ion

# Strong and Weak Acids and Bases
Acids and bases that are strong electrolytes (completely ionized in solution) are **strong acids** and **strong bases**. Those that are weak electrolytes (partly ionized) are **weak acids** and **weak bases**

| Strong Acids               | Strong Bases                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hydrochloric Acid ($HCl$)  | Group 1A metal hydroxides ($LiOH,NaOH,KOH,RbOH,CsOH$)          |
| Hydrobromic Acid ($HBr$)   | Heavy Group 2A metal hydroxides ($Ca(OH)_2,Sr(OH)_2,Ba(OH)_2$) |
| Hydroiodic Acid ($HI$)     |                                                                |
| Chloric Acid ($HClO_3$)    |                                                                |
| Perchloric Acid ($HClO_4$) |                                                                |
| Nitric Acid ($HNO_3$)      |                                                                |
| Sulfuric Acid ($H_2SO_4$)  |                                                                |

# Identifying Strong and Weak Electrolytes
we can make reasonable predictions about the electrolytic strength of a great number of water soluble substances
To classify if it is strong or weak work down this table

|               | Strong Electrolyte | Weak Electrolyte       | Nonelectrolyte      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Ionic**     | All                | None                   | None                |
| **Molecular** | Strong Acids       | Weak Acids, Weak Bases | All other compounds |

# Neutralization Reactions and Salts
When a solution of an acid and a solution of a base are mixed, a neutralization reaction occurs. The products of the reaction have none of the characteristic properties of either the acidic solution or the basic solution
For example when hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are mixed we get the chemical equation$$HCl(aq)+NaOH(aq)\ce{->}H_2O(l)+NaCl(aq)$$
Both water and salt are not acids or bases
By analogy to this reaction, the term salt has come to mean any ionic compound whose cation comes from a base and whose anion comes from an acid
In general, a neutralization reaction between an acid and a metal hydroxide produces water and a salt
