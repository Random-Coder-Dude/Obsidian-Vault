electrons are transferred from one reactant to another. Such reactions are called either **oxidation-reduction reactions** or **redox reactions**

# Oxidation and Reduction
One of the most common examples of a redox reaction is the corrosion of metal. This is also known as rusting
When an atom or ion loses electrons in a chemical reaction it is called **oxidation**, similarly when an atom or ion gains electrons in a chemical reaction it is called **reduction**
One example of oxidation is$$2Ca(s)+O_2(g)\ce{->}2CaO(s)$$
All of these type of reactions feature an equal amount of oxidation and reduction. This is necessary to balance the charges
