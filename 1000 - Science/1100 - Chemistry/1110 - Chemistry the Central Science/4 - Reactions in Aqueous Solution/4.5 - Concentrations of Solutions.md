Scientists use the term **concentration** to designate the amount of solute dissolved in a given quantity of solvent or quantity of solution

# Molarity
Molarity express the concentration of a solution as the number of moles of a solute in a liter of solution$$\text{Molarity}=\frac{\text{moles solute}}{\text{volume of solution in liters}}$$

# Expressing the Concentration of an Electrolyte
When an ionic compound dissolves, the relative concentrations of the ions in the solution depend on the chemical formula of the compound
Thus, the concentration of an electrolyte solution can be specified either in terms of the compound used to make the solution or in terms of the ions in the solution

# Interconverting Molarity Moles and Volume
If we know any 2 quantities it is trivial to find the third
Basically it is solving for the missing piece

# Dilution
Solutions used routinely in the laboratory are often purchased or prepared in concentrated form called **stock solutions**
These can then be made less powerful through **dilution**
Dilution is when you add water to a solution in order to make it less powerful
