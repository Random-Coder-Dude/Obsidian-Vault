Stoichiometry with these solutions can seem a little bit daunting but it is simplified by this chart

# Titrations
To determine the concentration of a particular solute in a solution, chemists often carry out a **titration**, which involves combining a solution where the solute concentration is not known with a reagent solution of known concentration, called a **standard solution**. Just enough standard solution is added to completely react with the solute in the solution of unknown concentration. The point at which stoichiometrically equivalent quantities are brought together is known as the **equivalence point**
Using this information it is then possible to figure the concentratio
