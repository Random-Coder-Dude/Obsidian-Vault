**Matter** - The physical stuff the world is made out of
**Energy** - The capacity to do work or transfer heat 
This begs the question what is heat and what is work?
**Heat** - the energy used to cause the temperature of an object to increase
**Work** - the energy used to cause an object to move against a force

# Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy
All objects can have **kinetic energy**, the energy of motion. The magnitude of kinetic energy on an object depends on two things its mass $m$ and its speed $v$ the formula is as follows$$E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
In chemistry we are mainly concerned with the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules
**Potential Energy** is the energy stored in chemical bonds or in a stretched spring
An object has potential energy by virtue of its position in space and what objects its near to
Both of the types of energy can be in an object at once. Similarly when an object needs to move it converts its potential energy into kinetic energy and vice versa is also possible.
This is the cornerstone of thermodynamics
One of the most important forms of potential energy in the context of chemistry is the **electrostatic potential energy** it arises from the interactions between charged particles$$E_{el}=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{d}$$
where $k$ is simpily a constant of proportanility which is always $8.99\cdot 10^{9}\text{ Jm/C^2}$
