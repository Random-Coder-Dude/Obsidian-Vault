**Matter** - The physical stuff the world is made out of
**Energy** - The capacity to do work or transfer heat 
This begs the question what is heat and what is work?
**Heat** - the energy used to cause the temperature of an object to increase
**Work** - the energy used to cause an object to move against a force

# Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy
All objects can have **kinetic energy**, the energy of motion. The magnitude of kinetic energy on an object depends on two things its mass $m$ and its speed $v$ the formula is as follows$$E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
In chemistry we are mainly concerned with the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules
**Potential Energy** is the energy stored in chemical bonds or in a stretched spring
An object has potential energy by virtue of its position in space and what objects its near to
Both of the types of energy can be in an object at once. Similarly when an object needs to move it converts its potential energy into kinetic energy and vice versa is also possible.
This is the cornerstone of thermodynamics
One of the most important forms of potential energy in the context of chemistry is the **electrostatic potential energy** it arises from the interactions between charged particles$$E_{el}=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{d}$$
where $k$ is simply a constant of proportionality which is always $8.99\cdot 10^{9}\text{ J-m/}C^2$
As $E_{el}$ is positive we know the particles are repelling each other similarly if $E_{el}$ is negative the particles are attracting each other

# Units of Energy
The SI unit for energy is the **joule** ($J$). By definition $1J=\text{ kg-}m^2/s^2$. This ties nicely into the calculation for kinetic energy because$$E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{1}{2}(\text{kg})(m/s)^2=1kg\text{-}m^2/s^2=1J$$
The calorie is also defined as an unit of energy equaling the amount of energy needed to hat 1g of water from $14.5C\degree$ to $15.5C\degree$ which is exactly the conversion$$1\text{ cal }=4.184J$$
Also do not confuse Calorie with calorie, the capital C actually means it is a kcal or 1000 calories

# System and Surroundings
When analyzing energy movement we have to define a **system** where we can track the energy leaving or entering. Everything that is outside the system is called the **surroundings**. There are 3 types of systems, open, closed and isolated. 
An **open system** is one in which matter and energy can be exchanged with the surroundings
**Closed systems** - systems that can exchange energy but not matter with their surroundings
An **isolated system** is one in which neither energy nor matter can be exchanged with
the surroundings, these are very hard if not impossible to make

# Transferring Energy: Work and Heat
Two ways we experience energy changes is through heat and work.
What is work?$$w=F\times d$$ In this case
