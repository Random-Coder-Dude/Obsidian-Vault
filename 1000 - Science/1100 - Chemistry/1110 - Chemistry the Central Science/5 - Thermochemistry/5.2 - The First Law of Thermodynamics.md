Energy can be neither created or destroyed
This is the basis of thermodynamics and calorimetry
This important observation that energy is conserved is known as the **first law of thermodynamics**

# Internal Energy
We define the internal energy of a system as the sum ($E$) of all the kinetic and potential energy already present in the system
Mostly in chemistry we don't know the value of $E$ but that is fine because we are most concerned about $\Delta E$ or the change in the internal temperature
$\Delta E$ is defined as$$\Delta E=E_{\text{final}}-E_{\text{initial}}$$
We usually also cannot find $E_{\text{final}}\text{ or }E_{\text{initial}}$ however it doesn't matter because we can still apply the law due to the first law of thermodynamics
A positive value of $\Delta E$ means that the system gained energy from its surroundings and similarly if $\Delta E$ is negative the system lost energy to its surroundings
In a chemical reaction the initial state of a system is the energy of the reactants and the final state is the energy of the products
