Energy can be neither created or destroyed
This is the basis of thermodynamics and calorimetry
This important observation that energy is conserved is known as the **first law of thermodynamics**

# Internal Energy
We define the internal energy of a system as the sum ($E$) of all the kinetic and potential energy already present in the system
Mostly in chemistry we dont know the value of $E$ but that is fine because we are most concerned about $\delta E$
