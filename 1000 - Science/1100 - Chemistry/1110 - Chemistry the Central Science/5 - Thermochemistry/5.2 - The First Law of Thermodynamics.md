Energy can be neither created or destroyed
This is the basis of thermodynamics and calorimetry
This important observation that energy is conserved is known as the **first law of thermodynamics**

# Internal Energy
We define the internal energy of a system as the sum ($E$) of all the kinetic and potential energy already present in the system
Mostly in chemistry we don't know the value of $E$ but that is fine because we are most concerned about $\Delta E$ or the change in the internal temperature
$\Delta E$ is defined as$$\Delta E=E_{\text{final}}-E_{\text{initial}}$$
We usually also cannot find $E_{\text{final}}\text{ or }E_{\text{initial}}$ however it doesn't matter because we can still apply the law due to the first law of thermodynamics
A positive value of $\Delta E$ means that the system gained energy from its surroundings and similarly if $\Delta E$ is negative the system lost energy to its surroundings
In a chemical reaction the initial state of a system is the energy of the reactants and the final state is the energy of the products

# Relating $\definecolor{heading}{rgb}{0.875,0.29,0.086}\textcolor{heading}{\Delta E}$ to Heat and Work
$\Delta E$ is kind of like a bank account where you can add energy or remove energy from the system. $\Delta E$ tracks your change in balance. This allows us to create some useful algebraic equations which can help us determine $\Delta E$ easily. For example$$\Delta E=q+w$$
where $q$ is the total amount of heat gained or lost by the system and $w$ is the total amount of work done on or by the system
When heat is added or work is done to the system its internal energy increases. Therefore $+q$ means that heat is being added to the system similarly $+w$ means that work is being done on the system

# Endothermic and Exothermic Processes
When a process occurs in which $\Delta E$ is positive (The system gains energy) it is called a **endothermic reaction** 
When a process occurs in which $\delta E$ is negative (The system losses energy) it is called a **exothermic reaction**

# State Functions
Although we usually have no way of knowing the precise value of the internal energy of a system, $E$, it does have a fixed value for a given set of conditions. The conditions that influence internal energy include the temperature and pressure
Suppose we define our system as 50g of water at $25\degree C$. The system could have gotten here from cooling 50g of water at $50\degree C$ or even heating 50g of water from $0\degree C$. However the internal energy of the water in both cases is the same. Internal energy is an example of a **state function**. The value of a state function depends only on the present state of the system, not on the path the system took to reach that state
An analogy may help you understand the difference between quantities that are state functions and those that are not. Suppose you drive from Chicago, which is 596 ft above sea level, to Denver, which is 5280 ft above sea level. No matter which route you take, the altitude change is 4684 ft. The distance you travel, however, depends on your route. Altitude is analogous to a state function because the change in altitude
Some thermodynamic quantities like $E$ are state functions but there are also some that are not like $q$ and $w$. One interesting property this has is that any amount of $q$ increasing from 1 case to another would proportionally decrease $w$ in order to keep $\Delta E$ the same
Basically if we know $\Delta E$ then the exact values of $q$ and $w$ don't matter because whatever they are is forced to constrain to $\Delta E=q+w$
