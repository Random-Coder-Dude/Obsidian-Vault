A new state function called **enthalpy** is defined as$$H=E+PV$$
The work involved in pressuring a gas is called P-V work where $$w=-P\Delta V$$
Through substitution we get the formula$$\Delta H=q_p$$
This means that under constant pressure the enthalpy is equal to the heat gained or lost
This means that when $\Delta H$ is positive the system has gained heat from the surroundings, similarly is $\Delta H$ is negative then the system has lost energy
