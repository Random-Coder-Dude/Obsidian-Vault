Because $\Delta$ is defined as $\text{final }-\text{ initial}$ the enthalpy for chemical reaction is $$\Delta H=H_{\text{products}}-H_{\text{reactants}}$$
The enthalpy change that accompanies a reaction is called the **enthalpy of reaction**
The notation is as follows$$2H_2(g)+O_2(g)\ce{->}2H_2O(g)\quad\quad\Delta H=-483.6kJ$$
The negative value of $\Delta H$ tells us this reaction is exothermic. Notice that $\Delta H$ is reported at the end of the balanced equation. In this case it is the enthalpy for the listed coefficients reacting. Different amounts of moles have different enthalpies

The following guidelines will help a lot
1. Enthalpy is an extensive property. The magnitude of $\Delta H$ is proportional to the amount of reactant consumed in the process For example, 890 kJ of heat is produced when 1 mol of CH4 is burned in a constant-pressure system:$$CH_4(g)+2O_2(g)\ce{->}$$
