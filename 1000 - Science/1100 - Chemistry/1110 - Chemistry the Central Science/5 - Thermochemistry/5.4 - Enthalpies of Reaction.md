Because $\Delta$ is defined as $\text{final }-\text{ initial}$ the enthalpy for chemical reaction is $$\Delta H=H_{\text{products}}-H_{\text{reactants}}$$
The enthalpy change that accompanies a reaction is called the **enthalpy of reaction**
The notation is as follows$$2H_2(g)+O_2(g)\ce{->}2H_2O(g)\quad\quad\Delta H=-483.6kJ$$
The negative value of $\Delta H$ tells us this reaction is exothermic. Notice that $\Delta H$ is reported at the end of the balanced equation. In this case it is the enthalpy for the listed coefficients reacting. Different amounts of moles have different enthalpies

The following guidelines will help a lot
1. **Enthalpy is an extensive property**. The magnitude of $\Delta H$ is proportional to the amount of reactant consumed in the process For example, 890 kJ of heat is produced when 1 mol of CH4 is burned in a constant-pressure system:$$CH_4(g)+2O_2(g)\ce{->}CO_2(g)+2H_2O(l)\quad\quad\Delta H=-890kJ$$Because the combustion of 1 mol of $CH_4$ with 2 mol of $O_2$ releases 890 kJ of heat, the combustion of 2 mol of $CH_4$ with 4 mol of $O_2$ releases twice as much heat,1780 kJ
2. **The enthalpy change for a reaction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to $\definecolor{bolded}{rgb}{1,0.435,0.38}\textcolor{bolded}{\Delta H}$ for the reverse reaction.**
3. **The enthalpy change for a reaction depends on the states of the reactants and products.**
