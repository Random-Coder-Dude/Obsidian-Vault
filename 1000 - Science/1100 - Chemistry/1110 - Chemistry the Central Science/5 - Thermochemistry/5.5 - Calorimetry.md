The value of $\Delta H$ can be determined experimentally this is called **calorimetry**

# Heat Capacity and Specific Heat
The more heat an object gains the hotter the object gets
However not all objects gain and lose temperature at the same rate
The constant of proportionality between heat and temperature is called the objects **heat capacity**, it is denoted by a $C$
It is commonly written in the units $$C=\frac{J}{\degree C}$$
The **molar heat capacity** is functionally the same thing but expressed in the units$$C_m=\frac{J}{mol\cdot\degree C}$$
And there is also the **specific heat capacity** expressed in $$C_s=\frac{J}{g\cdot\degree C}$$
All of these values can be experimentally found by using the same formula (Here is the one for specific heat capacity)$$C_s=\frac{\text{quantity of heat transferred}}{\text{grams of a substance}\cdot\text{change in temprature}}=\frac{q}{m\cdot\Delta T}$$
Rearranging this equation we get$$q=m\cdot C_s\cdot\Delta T$$
Thus we can now calculate any value we need when we have the other values

# Constant Pressure Calorimetry
For many reactions such as reactions in solutions it is easy to keep the pressure a constant so we can measure $\Delta H$ directly 
Imagine adding two aqueous solutions, each containing a reactant, to a coffee-cup calorimeter. Once mixed, the reactants can react to form products. In this case there is no physical boundary between the system and the surroundings. The reactants and products of the reaction are the system, and the water in which they are dissolved is part of the surroundings
That is the definition of a calorimeter
To calculate values we use the formula$$-(m_{water}\cdot\frac{4.184J}{g\cdot\degree C}\cdot(T_{final}-T_{initial}))=m_{reactants}\cdot\frac{4.184J}{g\cdot\degree C}\cdot(T_{final}-T_{initial})$$
in other words $-\text{heat lost }=\text{ heat gained}$

# Bomb Calorimetry
Combustion reactions are most accurately studied using a bomb calorimeter

Here we can calculate a value called the **heat capacity of the calorimeter** by taking the heat capacity of the water. It is often easier to just use $q=mc\Delta T$
