The value of $\Delta H$ can be determined experimentally this is called **calorimetry**

# Heat Capacity and Specific Heat
The more heat an object gains the hotter the object gets
However not all objects gain and lose temperature at the same rate
The constant of proportionality between heat and temperature is called the objects **heat capacity**, it is denoted by a $C$
It is commonly written in the units $$C=\frac{J}{\degree C}$$
The **molar heat capacity** is functionally the same thing but expressed in the units$$C_m=\frac{J}{mol\cdot\degree C}$$
And there is also the **specific heat capacity** expressed in $$C_s=\frac{J}{g\cdot\degree C}$$
All of these values can be experimentally found by using the same formula (Here is the one for specific heat capacity)$$C_s=\frac{\text{quantity of heat transferred}}{\text{grams of a substance}\cdot\text{change in temprature}}=\frac{q}{m\cdot\Delta T}$$
Rearranging this equation we get$$q=m\cdot C_s\cdot\Delta T$$
Thus we can now calculate any value we need when we have the other values
