It is often possible to calculate the $\Delta H$ of a reaction
We can use certain reactions to calculate the $\Delta H$ of many reactions through **Hess's Law**
**Hessâ€™s law** states that if a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, for the overall reaction equals the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps. The overall enthalpy change for the process is independent of the number of steps and independent of the path by which the reaction is carried out
This can be proven by the fact that enthalpy is both extensive and a state function
It is super easy to use

Basically a system of equations where you cross out redundant terms
