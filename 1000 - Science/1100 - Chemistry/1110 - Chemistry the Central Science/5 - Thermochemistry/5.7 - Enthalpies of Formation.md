Extensive tables already exist for any type of enthalpy
A particularly important process used for tabulating thermochemical data is the formation of a compound from its constituent elements. The enthalpy change associated with this process is called the **enthalpy of formation** ($\Delta H_f$)
It is exactly what it sounds like
The **standard enthalpy change** of a reaction is defined as the enthalpy change when all reactants and products are in their standard states. We denote a standard enthalpy change as $\Delta H\degree$, where the superscript indicates standard-state conditions
Obviously the 2 terms can be combined to be **the standard enthalpy of formation** which can be shown as follows$$\begin{aligned}
&\text{If:} &\text{elements (in standard state)}\ce{->}\text{compound (1 mol in standard state)}\\
&\text{Then:} &\Delta H=\Delta H_f
\end{aligned}$$
If an element has 2 forms at 298K we use the form that is more stable
By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of the most stable form of any element is zero because there is no formation reaction needed when the element is already in its standard state

# Using Enthalpies of Formation to Calculate Enthalpies of Reaction
We can use Hess's Law as follows in order to figure out the $\Delta H$ of any reaction we want
Using the equation$$\Delta H_{rxn}=\sum n\Delta H_f\degree(\text{products})-\sum m\Delta H_f\degree(\text{reactants})$$
where $m$ and $n$ are the number of moles for each substance
