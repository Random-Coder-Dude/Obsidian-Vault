There are many types of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves, x rays and infrared
All types of electromagnetic radiation move at the same speed $3.00\cdot10^8m/s$ which is called the speed of light
Remember these terms

The **frequency of the wave** is the amount of cycles which cross a point in 1 second
The **wavelength of the wave** is the distance between 2 peaks on the wave
Frequency is represented by $\nu$ and wavelength is represented by $\lambda$ this allows us to define $$c=\lambda\nu$$
where $c$ is the speed of light
Also understand how the wavelength and by extension frequency impact the visibility and classification of the wave

Frequency is usually represented in (Hz) which is $\frac{\text{cycles}}{\text{second}}$
Similarly wavelength is represented in (m) or a similar unit of length
