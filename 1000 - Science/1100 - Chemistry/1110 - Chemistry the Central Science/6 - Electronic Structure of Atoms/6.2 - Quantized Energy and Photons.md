Although the wave model of light explains a lot about light it falls short on 3 specific problems
1. The blackbody problem
2. The photelectric effect
3. Emission Spectra
Just search them up if you want to know what they are

# Hot Objects and the Quantization of Energy
When solids are heated they emit radiation
The wavelength of the light depends on the temperature of the object
Scientists tried finding the exact relation however they were not able to find a relation
In 1900 Max Planck realized that energy can only be transferred in discrete chunks which he called **quantum** he additionally found that these quantum energy chunks followed the relation$$E=h\nu$$
Its a $\nu$ not a v it has nothing to do with velocity
This constant is called the Planck constant and is defined as $6.62\cdot10^{-34}J$ a very small number
That's why it seems like energy is not quantized when in fact it is

# The Photoelectric Effect and Photons
Albert Einstein used Plank's theory to explain why metals when light was shined on them produced electrons
Einstein assumed that each "unit" of light could be represented as a **photon** which is equal to $\text{Energy of a Photon}=E=h\nu$. Using this he was able to say each metal when bombarded with enough energy in the form of photons would eventually destabilize the bonds enough that the electrons would break free

He did win the Nobel Prize for this
