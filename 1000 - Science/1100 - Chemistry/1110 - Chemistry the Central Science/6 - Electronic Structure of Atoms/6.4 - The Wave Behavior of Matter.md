Another scientist DeBroglie suggested the following equation
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$
where the $v$ is actually a v. This introduced the idea that all matter can be represented by both waves and by positions. 

# The Uncertainty Principle
Because of DeBroglie's theory it was found that
$$\Delta x\cdot\Delta (mv)\ge\frac{h}{4\pi}$$
This is called the **uncertainty principle** it means that if you know the precise place an object is it is impossible to be more precise than this equation for the velocity of the object because of the wave / matter and how they both interact with your measuring. If you are curios you may look here for why there is a $4\pi$ in the equation (Good Luck [quantum chemistry - Significance of 4Ï€ in the uncertainty principle - Chemistry Stack Exchange](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/16392/significance-of-4%CF%80-in-the-uncertainty-principle))

Because electrons weigh so less and they are so small it turns out that if we measure the electron its uncertainty in position is bigger than the atom itself. Meaning we have no idea where electrons are in atoms
