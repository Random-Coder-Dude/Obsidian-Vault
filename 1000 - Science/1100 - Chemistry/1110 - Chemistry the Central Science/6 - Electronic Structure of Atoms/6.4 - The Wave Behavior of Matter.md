Another scientist DeBroglie suggested the following equation
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$
where the $v$ is actually a v. This introduced the idea that all matter can be represented by both waves and by positions. 

# The Uncertainty Principle
Because of DeBroglie's theory it was found that
$$\Delta x\cdot\Delta (mv)\ge\frac{h}{4\pi}$$
This is called the **uncertainty principle** it means that if you know the precise place an object is it is impossible to be more precise than this equation for the velocity of the object because of the wave / matter and how they both interact with ypur measuring. If you are cu
