Another scientist DeBroglie suggested the following equation
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$
where the $v$ is actually a v. This introduced the idea that all matter can be represented by both waves and by positions. 

# The Uncertainty Principle
Because of DeBroglie's theory it was found that
$$\Delta x\cdot\Delta (mv)\ge\frac{h}{4\pi}$$
This is called the uncertainty principle
