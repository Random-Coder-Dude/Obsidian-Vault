# 6.1
Light is a form of radiation
Light has two attributes its wavelength ($\lambda$) and its frequency ($\nu$)
Make sure you know $$c=\nu\lambda$$
$c$ is the speed of light
Also know the dimensional analysis shown below
## Example (6.11)
If a wave of light has a frequency of $6.01\cdot10^7s^{-1}$ what is its wavelength and which type of wave would this be most similar too?

First figure out what the question is asking
a) What is the wavelength ($\lambda$)
b) What type of radiation would this be

By applying the equation
$$c=\nu\lambda$$
Then plugging in values
$$\frac{3.00\cdot10^8(m)}{(s)}=\frac{6.01\cdot10^7}{s^{-1}}\cdot{\lambda(m)}$$
Then solving with basic algebra **You have bigger problems if you can't do this**
$$4.99(m)=\lambda(m)$$
**Remember Significant Figures**
You have solved part a, the wavelength is $4.99m$
Now to solve part b we look back at this image

Noticing where the wavelength and frequency line up on the graph we can conclude this radiation would be a radio wave

# 6.2
There were 3 big problems in chemistry at this time. 
1. Blackbody Problem
2. Photoelectric Effect
3. Emission Spectra

## Blackbody Problem
Basically scientists wanted to find an equation which related the temperature of a blackbody to the wavelength / frequency of the energy it emitted. 
However any attempts to do so always ended with an equation that asymptotes towards infinity (Not in the good way). It also didn't follow experimental results. 

## Photoelectric Effect
Scientists were looking to explain why bombarding a metal with light sometimes released electrons from the metal. It was an inequality where the metal would only release electrons if the frequency of the light was greater or lower than a value. 

## Planck's Constant
Eventually Planck solved both of these problems by saying energy is quantized and calculating the smallest "steps" energy. He then created a simple equation$$E=h\nu$$
Where $h$ is Planck's constant. This law in conjunction with the relation between wavelength and frequency can be used to solve questions.

## Example (6.21)
If you had a metal that began to release electrons due to the photoelectric effect at $20kJ$ of energy what would the minimum wavelength be required to trigger this effect?

First what are they asking
a) What is the wavelength of the radiation

$$\frac{c(m)}{(s)}=\lambda(m)\cdot\frac{\nu}{s}$$
$$E(J)=h(J\cdot s)\cdot\frac{\nu}{(s)}$$
$$\frac{c(m)}{s\lambda(m)}=\frac{\nu}{(s)}$$
$$E(J)=h(J\cdot s)\cdot\frac{c(m)}{(s)\lambda(m)}$$
Plug in values
$${20kJ}\cdot\frac{1000J}{1kJ}=6.63\cdot10^{-34}(J\cdot s)\cdot\frac{3.00\cdot10^8(m)}{(s)\lambda(m)}$$
Solve for $\lambda$
You should have gotten
$$9.9\cdot10^{-30}(m)=\lambda(m)$$
So our final answer is $9.9\cdot10^{-30}m$

## Emission Spectra
