# 6.1
Light is a form of radiation
Light has two attributes its wavelength ($\lambda$) and its frequency ($\nu$)
Make sure you know $$c=\nu\lambda$$
$c$ is the speed of light
Also know the dimensional analysis shown below
## Example (6.11)
If a wave of light has a frequency of $6.01\cdot10^7s^{-1}$ what is its wavelength and which type of wave would this be most similar too?

First figure out what the question is asking
a) What is the wavelength ($\lambda$)
b) What type of radiation would this be

By applying the equation
$$c=\nu\lambda$$
Then plugging in values
$$\frac{3.00\cdot10^8(m)}{(s)}=\frac{6.01\cdot10^7}{s^{-1}}\cdot{\lambda(m)}$$
Then solving with basic algebra **You have bigger problems if you can't do this**
$$4.99(m)=\lambda(m)$$
**Remember Significant Figures**
You have solved part a, the wavelength is $4.99m$
Now to solve part b we look back at this image

Noticing where the wavelength and frequency line up on the graph we can conclude this radiation would be a radio wave

There were 3 big problems in chemistry at this time. 
1. Blackbody Problem
2. Photoelectric Effect
3. Emission Spectra

## Blackbody Problem
Bassicly scientists wanted to find an equation which related the temprature of a blackbody to the wavelength / frequancy o
