# 6.1
Light is a form of radiation
Light has two attributes its wavelength ($\lambda$) and its frequency ($\nu$)
Make sure you know $$c=\nu\lambda$$
$c$ is the speed of light
Also know the dimensional analysis shown below
## Example (6.11)
If a wave of light has a frequency of $6.01\cdot10^7s^{-1}$ what is its wavelength and which type of wave would this be most similar too?

First figure out what the question is asking
a) What is the wavelength ($\lambda$)
b) What type of radiation would this be

By applying the equation$$\frac{c(m)}{(s)}=\frac{6.01}{}$$
