Elements in the same column contain the same number of electrons in their **valence orbitals**, which are the occupied orbitals that hold the electrons involved in bonding.

# Before the Periodic Table 

Some elements like gold (Au) have been discovered since ancient times because they occur naturally in nature whereas elements like technetium (Tc), have only been discovered in modern times due to their radioactivity and instability 

The majority of elements readily form compounds and, consequently, are not found in nature 
	-> Until 19th century tech that could separate them, they were thus unknown
	-> the number of known elements more than doubled from 31 in 1800 to 63 by 1865.

# Mendeleev and Mayer Develop the Table

- In **1869**, **Mendeleev** and **Meyer** arranged elements by **increasing atomic weight**.
- They noticed **periodic repetition of properties**.
- **Mendeleev** left **blank spaces** for undiscovered elements (e.g. **eka-Al → Ga**, **eka-Si → Ge**) and predicted their properties correctly.
- He’s credited because he promoted his table more strongly, and most imp
