Elements in the same column contain the same number of electrons in their **valence orbitals**, which are the occupied orbitals that hold the electrons involved in bonding.

# Before the Periodic Table 

Some elements like gold (Au) have been discovered since **ancient times** because they **occur naturally** in nature whereas elements like technetium (Tc), have only been discovered in **modern times** due to their **radioactivity and instability** 

The majority of elements **readily form compounds** and, consequently, are not found in nature 
	-> Until 19th century tech that could **separate** them, they were thus **unknown**
	-> the number of known elements more than doubled from 31 in 1800 to 63 by 1865.

# Mendeleev and Mayer Develop the Table

- In **1869**, **Mendeleev** and **Meyer** arranged elements by **increasing atomic weight**.
- They noticed **periodic repetition of properties**. 
- **Mendeleev** left **blank spaces** for undiscovered elements (e.g. **eka-Al → Ga**, **eka-Si → Ge**) and predicted their properties correctly.
- He’s credited because he promoted his table more strongly, and most importantly, because he insisted that **elements with similar properties** must be in the **same rows** leading to the aforementioned blank spaces

# Moseley and Atomic Number

- In **1913**, **Henry Moseley** showed each element has a unique **atomic number** (number of protons).
	- This was done by firing high-energy electrons at atoms and ordering the released x-rays by frequency 
- Rearranging by **atomic number** fixed inconsistencies (e.g. **Ar** heavier than **K** but placed correctly by number).
- Modern periodic law:
	- Properties of elements repeat periodically when arranged by **atomic number**, not atomic weight.
