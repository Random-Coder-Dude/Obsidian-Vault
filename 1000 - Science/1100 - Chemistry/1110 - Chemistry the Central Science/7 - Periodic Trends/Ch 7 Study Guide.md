##  Atomic Radius

**Definition:**  
The *atomic radius* is the distance between the nucleus and the outermost electrons of an atom.

- **Bonding atomic radius (r):**  
  $( r = \frac{1}{2} d )$  
  where *d* = distance between two nuclei in a molecule.
- **Ionic radius:**  
  Determined from interatomic distances in ionic compounds.

---

###  Trends

- **Down a Group:** Atomic radius **increases**  
  → More electron orbitals → outer electrons farther from the nucleus.  
  *Example:* Li < Na < K < Rb

- **Across a Period:** Atomic radius **decreases**  
  → More protons = greater nuclear charge (**Zeff**) pulling electrons closer.  
  *Example:* Mg > Al > Si > S

---

###  Zeff (Effective Nuclear Charge)

- As electrons move closer to the nucleus, **Zeff increases**.  
- Stronger attraction between nucleus and outermost electrons = **smaller radius**.

---

## Cations vs. Anions

- **Cations (positive ions):**  
  Smaller than parent atoms → fewer electrons → less repulsion.

- **Anions (negative ions):**  
  Larger than parent atoms → more electrons → greater repulsion.

**Trend:** Ionic radius increases **down a group**.

---

### Reactivity

- Larger radius → easier to lose electrons (more reactive metals).  
- Smaller radius → harder to lose electrons (less reactive).

> [!example]
> **Deviation Example:** Gallium (Ga) is smaller than Aluminum (Al) due to poor shielding by 3d electrons.

##  Ionization Energy

**Definition:**  
Energy (in joules) required to remove an electron from an atom.

**Trends:**
- **Increases across a period** (smaller atoms → stronger nuclear pull).  
- **Decreases down a group** (larger atoms → weaker pull).

**Relation to Atomic Radius:**  
- Smaller atoms = higher ionization energy  
- Larger atoms = lower ionization energy

---

## Electron Affinity

**Definition:**  
The energy change when an electron is added to a gaseous atom.

- Measures how much an atom **wants** to gain an electron.  
- The **more negative** the value, the **stronger** the attraction.

---

### Comparison: Electron Affinity vs. Ionization Energy

| Property | Definition | Trend |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Ionization Energy** | Energy required to **lose** an electron | Increases → across period |
| **Electron Affinity** | Energy change when **gaining** an electron | Becomes more negative → across period |

> [!note]
> Noble gases have **positive** electron affinity — they resist adding electrons because their octet is already complete.

---

## Electronegativity

**Definition:**  
The ability of an atom to attract electrons toward itself in a bond.

---

### Trends

- **Increases → across a period**
- **Decreases ↓ down a group**

**Key Points:**
- **Halogens** → most electronegative (want electrons to fill octet)  
- **Metals** → least electronegative (prefer to lose electrons)  
- **Nonmetals** → generally more electronegative

## Isoelectronic Series & Ionic Radius

**Definition:**  
Series of atoms/ions with the **same number of electrons**.

**Example:**  
Each species below has 10 electrons:  
Ne, Na⁺, Mg²⁺, F⁻, O²⁻

### Trend:
- **As Zeff increases → radius decreases** (more protons, stronger pull)  
- **Cations** → smaller  
- **Anions** → larger

---

##  Oxidation States & Properties

As **oxidation state increases** (e.g., Fe → Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺):

- Ionization energy ↑  
- Electron affinity ↑  
- Ionic radius ↓ (fewer electrons → stronger nuclear pull)

---

### Common Oxidation States by Group

| Group | Charge | Example |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 (1A) | +1 | Na⁺ |
| 2 (2A) | +2 | Mg²⁺ |
| 13 (3A) | +3 | Al³⁺ |
| 14 (4A) | +4 / -4 | C⁴⁺ or C⁴⁻ |
| 15 (5A) | -3 | N³⁻ |
| 16 (6A) | -2 | O²⁻ |
| 17 (7A) | -1 | Cl⁻ |
| 18 (8A) | 0 | Ne |

---

##  Octet Rule

Atoms gain, lose, or share electrons to reach a stable configuration with **8 valence electrons**.

- During bonding, **ionization energy** and **electron affinity** values approach zero → atoms reach a more stable, lower-energy state.
