All chemical bonds are due to interactions between **valence electrons** which are electrons in the outermost shell (highest principal number) in the atom, there are some exceptions

The **Lewis Symbol** of an element is its symbol + its valence electrons arranged around it. For example

Because Sulfur has 6 valence electrons

# The Octet Rule
**Octet Rule** - Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons until they are surrounded by eight valence electrons

This is the same idea that atoms "try" to move towards noble gas configurations
An octet has full s and p orbitals for an certain atom
