All chemical bonds are due to interactions between **valence electrons** which are electrons in the outermost shell (highest principal number) in the atom, there are some exceptions

The **Lewis Symbol** of an element is its symbol + its valence electrons arranged around it. For example
$$
\text{H} \quad \text{:} \quad \text{O} \quad \text{:} \quad \text{H}
$$

$$
\text{O} \quad \text{with lone pairs:} \quad \cdot\cdot\text{O}\cdot\cdot
$$
