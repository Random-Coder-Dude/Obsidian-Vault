All chemical bonds are due to interactions between **valence electrons** which are electrons in the outermost shell (highest principal number) in the atom, there are some exceptions

The **Lewis Symbol** of an element is its symbol + its valence electrons arranged around it. For example
$$
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={font=\sffamily\bfseries}]
    \node (O) at (0,0) {O};
    \node at (-0.5,0.5) {:};
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {:};
    \node (H1) at (-1.5,-0.5) {H};
    \node (H2) at (1.5,-0.5) {H};
    \draw (O) -- (H1);
    \draw (O) -- (H2);
\end{tikzpicture}
$$
