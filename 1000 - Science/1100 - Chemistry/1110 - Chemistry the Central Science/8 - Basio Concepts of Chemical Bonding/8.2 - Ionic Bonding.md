Ionic substances are mostly formed due to a nonmetal and a metal reacting with each other
For example
$$\ce{Na(s)+\frac{1}{2}Cl_2(g)->NaCl(s)\quad\Delta H_f\degree= -410.9kJ}$$
This is sodium chloride
Lewis dot structure wise we get the following relation

The arrow indicating that an electron is moved from Na to Cl
You put a bracket on any element that then satisfies having 8 valance electrons

# Energetics of Ionic Bond Formation
What makes ionic compounds formations so endothermic (Release energy)?
This energy comes from a concept called **lattice energy** which is the energy required to completely separate one mole of a solid ionic compound into its gaseous ions

So the opposite is highly exothermic leading to the large negative values
