Ionic substances are mostly formed due to a nonmetal and a metal reacting with each other
For example
$$\ce{Na(s)+\frac{1}{2}Cl_2(g)->NaCl(s)\quad\Delta H_f\degree= -410.9kJ}$$
This is sodium chloride
Lewis dot structure wise we get the following relation

The arrow indicating that an electron is moved from Na to Cl
You put a bracket on any element that then satisfies having 8 valance electrons

# Energetics of Ionic Bond Formation
What makes ionic compounds formations so endothermic (Release energy)?
This energy comes from a concept called **lattice energy** which is the energy required to completely separate one mole of a solid ionic compound into its gaseous ions

So the opposite is highly exothermic leading to the large negative values

Some info

# Electron Configurations of Ions of the S- and P- Block Elements
Because forming ions which are uncommon (Breaking the octet rule) is so hard even though the lattice energy increases with ionic charge it is more energy stable to use the lower lattice energy but have the benefit of having a lower ionization energy or electron affinity to reach that lattice. thereby causing elements to form certain charge ions. You know what I am talking about

# Transition Metal Ions
Because ionization energies increase rapidly for each successive electron removed, the
lattice energies of ionic compounds are generally large enough to compensate for the
loss of up to only three electrons from atoms. Thus, we find cations with charges of $1+$, $2+$
, or in ionic compounds.
