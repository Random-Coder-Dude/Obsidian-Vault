# John Dalton’s Atomic Theory – Summary

## Core Ideas

> [!ABSTRACT]  
> John Dalton's atomic theory (early 1800s) was the first scientific model to describe matter in terms of atoms, laying the groundwork for modern chemistry.

### Main Postulates

1. **All matter is made of atoms**, indivisible and indestructible particles.  
2. **Atoms of a given element are identical** in mass and properties.  
3. **Atoms of different elements differ** in mass and properties.  
4. **Compounds are formed by a combination of atoms** of different elements in fixed, simple ratios.  
5. **Chemical reactions are rearrangements** of atoms—they are neither created nor destroyed.

## Impact & Limitations

> [!NOTE]  
> While foundational, some parts (like atoms being indivisible) were later revised with the discovery of subatomic particles.

- **Pioneered atomic thinking** in chemistry  
- **Explained chemical combination laws**  
- **Led to further discoveries** in atomic structure (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons)

## Why It Matters

> [!TIP]  
> Dalton’s theory introduced the idea that all chemical behavior can be explained by atomic interactions—a key shift in scientific thinking.
