What is the fundamental "stuff" from which the world is made up of?
Democritus (A Greek philosopher) described the world as being made up of small indivisible particles called *Atomos*
The notion of the atom resurfaced during the 17th century
John Dalton's work was based of 4 postulates
1. All elements are composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms
2. Atoms of the same element are identical. The atoms of any one element are different from those of any other element.
3. Atoms of different elements can physically mix together or can chemically combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds.
4. Chemical reactions occur when atoms are separated, joined or rearranged. Atoms of one element are never changed into atoms of another element in a chemical reaction.
This is called [[John Dalton's Atomic Theory]]
