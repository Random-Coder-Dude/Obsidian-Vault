Even though the atom is the smallest sample of an element, only the noble gasses are found in nature by themselves

# Molecules and Chemical Formulas
Several elements are found in nature in **molecular form**
This means that they are two or more of the same type of atom bonded together
For example oxygen is commonly found bonded to another oxygen in the form ($O_2$)
A molecule made up of two atoms is called **diatomic** 
There are a few elements that like being diatomic these are
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine 
($H_2,\ O_2,\ N_2,\ F_2,\ Cl_2,\ Br_2,\ I_2$)
Compounds composed of more than 1 type of atom are called **molecular compounds**. For example there is water ($H_2O$)

# Molecular and Empirical Formulas
Chemical formulas that indicate exact quantities of atoms in a molecule are called **chemical formulas** for example we have methane which is ($CH_4$) which means methane has exactly 1 carbon and 4 hydrogen
Chemical formulas that give the simplest fraction of the chemical formula are called **empirical formulas** for example hydrogen peroxide has the chemical formula ($H_2O_2$) but its empirical formula is ($HO$)
Whenever we know the molecular formula of a compound we can find its empirical formula but not vice versa

# Picturing Molecules
A **structural formula** of an atom describes the atoms and how they are bonded together for example the structural formula of water would look like this
A structural formula will not actually depict the exact angles and shape of a molecule but will show the bonds and atoms of the compound

A structural formula can be written as a **perspective drawing**, however, to give some sense of three-dimensional shape.

**Ball-and-stick models** show atoms as spheres and bonds as sticks. This type of model has the advantage of accurately representing the angles at which the atoms are attached to one another in the molecule

A **space-filling model** depicts what the molecule would look like if the atoms were
scaled up in size
