There are three major types of reactions in chemistry combination reactions, decomposition reactions, and combustion reactions

# Combination and Decomposition Reactions
In **combination reactions** two or more substances react to form on product for example$$\ce{2Mg(s) +O_2(g) -> 2MgO(s)}$$
A combination reaction between a metal and a nonmetal, produces an ionic solid
In a **decomposition reaction** one substance undergoes a reaction to produce two or more other substances for example$$\ce{CaCO_3(s)\overset{\Delta}{->}CaO(s) + CO_2(g)}$$

# Combustion Reactions
**Combustion reactions** are rapid reactions that produce a flame. Most combustion reactions we observe involve $O_2$ from air as a reactant. For example$$\ce{C_3H_8(g) +5O_2(g)->3CO_2(g)+4H_2O(g)}$$
The rule that hydrocarbons and their oxygen-containing derivatives form $CO_2$ and $H_2O$ when they burn in air summarizes the behavior of about 3 million compounds
