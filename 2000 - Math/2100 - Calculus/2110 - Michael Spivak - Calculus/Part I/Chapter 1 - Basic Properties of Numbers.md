This chapter will lay out 12 different properties of numbers. The first 9 are concerned with the fundamental operations of addition and multiplication

All properties will be written in this format
![[Associative Law for Addition#^ba1b60]]
This statement clearly shows there is no difference between the sum of two numbers and three numbers
![[Existence of an Additive Identity#^eace65]]
This statement shows that 0 does not change the value of *a* when they are summed together
![[Existence of Additive Inverses#^0d024a]]
While these properties might feel self explanatory they are there to create a solid foundation mathematicians can build off of
![[Commutative Law for Addition#^972351]]
![[Associative Law for Multiplication#^88a88a]]
![[Existence of a Multiplicative Identity#^f33ac7]]
![[Existence of Multiplicative Inverses#^1da6c4]]
![[Commutative Law for Multiplication#^eb3a85]]
![[Distributive Law#^5b9a4b]]
