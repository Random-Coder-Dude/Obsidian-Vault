This chapter will lay out 12 different properties of numbers. The first 9 are concerned with the fundamental operations of addition and multiplication

All properties will be written in this format
![[Associative Law for Addition#^ba1b60]]
This statement clearly shows there is no difference between the sum of two numbers and three numbers
![[Existence of an Additive Identity#^eace65]]
This statement shows that 0 does not change the value of *a* when they are summed together
![[Existence of Additive Inverses#^0d024a]]
While these properties might feel self explanatory they are there to create a solid foundation mathematicians can build off of
![[Commutative Law for Addition#^972351]]
![[Associative Law for Multiplication#^88a88a]]


> [!NOTE] Theory
> 7. for every number $a\neq0$, there is a number $a^{-1}$ such that$$a\cdot a^{-1}=a^{-1}\cdot a=1$$

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 8. if $a$ and $b$ are any numbers, then$$a\cdot b=b\cdot a$$

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 9. if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are any numbers, then$$a\cdot(b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c$$
