All of math can be described in sets. This affect is more noticeable at higher levels of math. The language of sets is perfect in describing math

# Introduction to Sets
A **set** is a collection of things
Each of those things is called an **element** of the set
We are mainly concerned with sets whose elements are mathematical entities such as numbers, points and functions
A set is expressed in the following way $\set{2,4,6,8}$ this is called a **finite set** because it doesn't have infinite elements. Conversely a set that contains all integers would be a **infinite set** and would be written as $\set{...,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,...}$
Here the dots indicate a pattern which continues in both directions
Two sets are **equal** if they contain exactly the same elements. For example the sets $\set{2,4,6,8}=\set{2,4,8,6}$ are equal. Even if the order of elements are shifted. Similarly two sets would be **unequal** if all of their elements do not match. For example $\set{2,4,6,8}\ne\set{2,4,6,7}$
