# The Atomic and Molecular Perspective of Chemistry
**Chemistry** -  The study of the properties and behavior of matter
**Matter** - The physical material of the universe
**Property** - Any characteristic that allows us to recognize a particular type of matter and to distinguish it from other types of matter
**Elements** - the 118 different substances that make up all of the universe
**Atoms** - The almost infinitesimally small building blocks of matter
**Molecules** - Two or more atoms joined together in specific shapes
**Macroscopic** - The world we live in
**Submicroscopic** - The world of atoms and molecules

# Why Study Chemistry?
By studying chemistry we learn the fundamental interactions of matter that create the universe. Understanding chemistry provides powerful insights into other areas of modern science, technology and engineering.
