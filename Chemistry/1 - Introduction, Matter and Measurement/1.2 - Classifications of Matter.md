# States of Matter
Matter can be in 3 common forms gas, liquid, and solid
These 3 forms are called **States of Matter**
gas (vapor) - has no fixed volume or shape, instead it conforms to the shape and volume of its container
liquid - has a distinct volume but no specific shape, it conforms to the shape of its container
solid - has a distinct volume and shape
The 3 states of matter represent differences in the molecular level
Gasses are far apart and moving at high speeds
Liquids have molecules that are fast moving but close together
Solids have molecules that can only wiggle slightly and are mostly fixed
Changes in temperature and pressure can cause phase changes

# Pure Substances
Most forms of matter that are common in daily life are not chemically pure. 
**Pure Substance** - A matter that has distinct properties and a composition that does
not vary from sample to sample
Two examples of pure substances are water ($H_2 O$) and salt ($NaCl$)
All pure substances are either elements or compounds. Elements are substances that cannot be decomposed down into simpler substances. **Compounds** are substances composed of two or more different types of atoms
Water is a compound containing 2 Hydrogen atoms and 1 Oxygen atom
Mixture - combinations of two or more substances in which each substance retains its chemical identity

# Elements
Currently there are 118 known elements
They vary greatly in abundance
**Chemical Symbols** - A symbol which represents and element, one or two letters with the first letter always capital
**Periodic Table** - In the periodic table the elements are arranged in columns so that closely related elements are grouped together.

# Compounds
Most elements can interact with other elements to form compounds
For example when hydrogen gas ($H_2$) and oxygen gas ($O_2$) burn together they form the compound water ($H_2 O$)
Pure water regardless of source consists of 11% hydrogen and 89% oxygen by mass
**Law of Constant Composition** (Law of Definite Proportions) - The elemental composition of a compound is always the same
Discovered by *Joseph Louis Proust* in about 1800
When 2 materials differ in composition or properties they are either composed of different compounds or they differ in purity

# Mixtures
Most of the matter that we encounter falls in this category 
Each substance in a mixture retains its chemical identity and properties
In contrast to pure substances these can have different compositions.
For example a cup of sweetened coffee can either contain a little sugar or a lot of sugar
There are 2 types of mixtures
Homogenous (Solutions) - Mixtures that are uniform throughout
Heterogenous - Mixtures that vary in texture and appearance in any typical sample
Solutions can be a solid, liquid or gas
