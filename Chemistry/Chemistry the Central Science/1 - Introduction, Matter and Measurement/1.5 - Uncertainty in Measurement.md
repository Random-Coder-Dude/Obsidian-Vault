There are two kinds of numbers encountered in scientific work 
**Exact Numbers** - Those whose values are known exactly
**Inexact Numbers** - Those whose values have some uncertainty
Most of the exact numbers we encounter have defined values such as a dozen (12) or the fact that there are exactly a 1000g in 1 kg
Exact numbers can also result from counting the amount of object
For example the amount of people in a room
Numbers obtained by measurement are always inexact. The equipment used to measure quantities has limitations
*Uncertainties always exist in measured quantities*

# Precision and Accuracy
**Precision** - how closely individual measurements agree with one another
**Accuracy** - how closely individual measurements agree with the correct, or “true,” value

# Significant Figures
Suppose you determine the mass of a dime on a balance capable of measuring to the
nearest 0.0001 g. You could report the mass as $2.2405 \pm 0.0001g$
In chemistry we drop the plus or minus in favor of assuming the last digit has uncertainty
All digits of a measured quantity are significant figures. The more significant figures the higher the certainty implied for the measurement
**Rules for determining significant figures**
1. Zeros between nonzero digits are always significant—1005 kg (four significant figures); 7.03 cm (three significant figures).
2. Zeros at the beginning of a number are never significant; they merely indicate the position of the decimal point—0.02 g (one significant figure); 0.0026 cm (two significant figures).
3. Zeros at the end of a number are significant if the number contains a decimal point—0.0200 g (three significant figures); 3.0 cm (two significant figures).

# Significant Figures in Calculations
For addition and subtraction, the result has the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places. When the result contains more than the correct number of significant figures, it must be rounded off

For multiplication and division, the result contains the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures. When the result contains more than the correct number of significant figures, it must be rounded off. For example, the area of a rectangle whose measured edge lengths are 6.221 cm and 5.2 cm should be reported as even though a calculator shows the product to have more digits

When a calculation involves two or more steps and you write answers for intermediate steps, retain at least one nonsignificant digit for the intermediate answers. This procedure ensures that small errors from rounding at each step do not combine to affect the final result. When using a calculator, you may enter the numbers one after another, rounding only the final answer
