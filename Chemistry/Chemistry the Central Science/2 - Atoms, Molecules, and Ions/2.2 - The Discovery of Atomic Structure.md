Both Dalton and peers had no direct evidence for the existence of atoms
As scientists started experimenting with atomic theory it became more clear that the atom had a more complex structure than previously imagined
We know today that the atom is composed of **subatomic particles** called electrons, protons and neutrons

# Cathode Rays and Electrons
One famous experiment of the time is the cathode rays experiment in which
electrical discharge was applied through a glass tube (in a vacuum state). When a high voltage was applied to the two electrodes, radiation was produced between them. This radiation called **Cathode Rays** originated from the negative electrode and traveled to the positive electrode. These rays were originally detected because they made certain materials florescence

> [!TIP]
> Think of the lightbulbs work (It is a similar concept)

For the discovery of the electron we learned that these cathode rays are deflected by magnetic or electric fields. This was then noticed to be consistent to the ray being a stream of negatively charged particles
J. J Thomson then observed that cathode rays are the same regardless of the cathode material
He then wrote a paper which is considered today as the discovery of the electron
He also found out the electrons charge to mass ratio which was $1.76\times10^8$ coulombs per gram. In 1909 Robert Millikan with his oil drop experiment succeeded in finding the electrons charge ($1.602\times10^{-19}C$) and by extension its mass ($9.10\times10^{-28}g$)
This agrees very well with the currently excepted value for electron mass. This mass is about 2000 times smaller than that of a single hydrogen atom

# Radioactivity
Henri Becquerel discovered that a compound of uranium spontaneously emits high-energy radiation. This spontaneous emission of radiation is called **radioactivity**
Further study on radioactivity led to the idea of 3 different types of radiation alpha ($\alpha$), beta ($\beta$) and gamma ($\gamma$)
$\alpha$ particles are considered to be high speed particles (mass about 7400 times of an electron) that are attracted to negatively charged plates. They have a charge of 2+
$\beta$ particles are basically high speed cathode rays that are attracted to positively charged plates. They have a charge of 1-
$\gamma$ radiation is a high-energy radiation that does not consist of particles or have any charge

# The Nuclear Model of the Atom
The first model was proposed by Thompson, he called it the plum pudding model. It looked something like this

This however was disproven by **Ernest Rutherford** who ran an experiment involving passing particles through a thin piece of gold foil. He noticed that some of the particles were being deflected at extreme angles which was not consistent with Thompson's model
He then proposed the nuclear model in which the electrons or
