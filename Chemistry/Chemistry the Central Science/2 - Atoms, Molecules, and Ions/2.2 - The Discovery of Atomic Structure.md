Both Dalton and peers had no direct evidence for the existence of atoms
As scientists started experimenting with atomic theory it became more clear that the atom had a more complex structure than previously imagined
We know today that the atom is composed of **subatomic particles** called electrons, protons and neutrons

# Cathode Rays and Electrons
One famous experiment of the time is the cathode rays experiment in which
electrical discharge was applied through a glass tube (in a vacuum state). When a high voltage was applied to the two electrodes, radiation was produced between them. This radiation called **Cathode Rays** originated from the negative electrode and traveled to the positive electrode. These rays were originally detected because they made certain materials florescence

> Think of the lightbulbs work (It is a similar concept)

For the discovery of the electron we learned that these cathode rays are deflected by magnetic or electric fields. This was then noticed to be consistent to the ray being a stream of negatively charged particles
J. J Thomson then observed that cathode rays are the same regardless of the cathode material.
