# The Atomic Mass Scale
Since the 19th century scientists have known that different elements have different masses
For example they knew in 100g of water there were 11.1g of hydrogen and 88.9g of oxygen using this they created a system of proportional masses in which hydrogen had a mass of 1 and oxygen had a mass of 16
Today through the mass spectrograph we know the exact masses of most elements
As stated previously 1 AMU (**Atomic Mass Unit**) has the conversion $1\text{amu}=1.66054\times10^{-24}\text{g}$ 
Presently 1 AMU is defined by $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of Carbon-12

# Atomic Weight
Most elements occur naturally in many different isotopes
