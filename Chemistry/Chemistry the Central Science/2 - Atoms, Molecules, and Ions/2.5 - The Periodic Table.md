As the amount of known elements increased, attempts were made in order to patterns in chemical behavior
These efforts created the **Periodic Table of Elements** in 1869
The periodic table is one of the most important tools in the chemists toolbox
Many elements show strong similarities to each other, for example sodium (Na) and potassium (K). If all the know elements were put into ascending order they would form a periodic pattern
The arrangement of elements in order of increasing atomic number, with elements having similar properties placed in vertical columns is known as the **periodic table** it looks like this
