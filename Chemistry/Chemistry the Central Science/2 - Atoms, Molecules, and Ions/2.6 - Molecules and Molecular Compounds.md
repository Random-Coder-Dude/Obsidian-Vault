Even though the atom is the smallest sample of an element, only the noble gasses are found in nature by themselves

# Molecules and Chemical Formulas
Several elements are found in nature in **molecular form**
This means that they are two or more of the same type of atom bonded together
For example oxygen is commonly found bonded to another oxygen in the form ($O_2$)
A molecule made up of two atoms is called **diatomic** 
There are a few elements that like being diatomic these are
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine 
($H_2,\ O_2,\ N_2,\ F_2,\ Cl_2,\ Br_2,\ I_2$)
Compounds composed of more than 1 type of atom are called **molecular compounds**. For example there is water ($H_2O$)

# Molecular and Empirical Formulas
Chemical formulas that indicate exact quantities of atoms in a molecule are called **chemical formulas** for example we have methane which is ($CH_4$) which means methane has exactly 1 carbon and 4 hydrogen
Chemical formulas that give the simplest fraction of the chemical formula are called **empirical formulas** for example
