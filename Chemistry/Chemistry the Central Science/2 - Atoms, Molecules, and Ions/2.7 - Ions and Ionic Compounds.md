The nucleus of an atom is unchanged by chemical processes
But some atoms can lose or gain electrons
If electrons are removed from or added to a atom it becomes charged this is called an **ion** 
An ion with a positive charge is called a **cation** (Losing an electron)
An ion with a negative charge is called an **anion** (Gaining an electron)

> [!TIP]
> In general, metal atoms tend to lose electrons to form cations and nonmetal atoms tend to gain electrons to form anions. Thus, ionic compounds tend to be composed of metals bonded with nonmetals, as in NaCl

In addition to simple ions like that there are also certain **polyatomic ions** which are compounds with a net nonzero charge. In other words they are ions that are not just composed of one atom
