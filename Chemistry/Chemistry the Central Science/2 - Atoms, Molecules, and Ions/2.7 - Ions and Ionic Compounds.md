The nucleus of an atom is unchanged by chemical processes
But some atoms can lose or gain electrons
If electrons are removed from or added to a atom it becomes charged this is called an **ion** 
An ion with a positive charge is called a **cation** (Losing an electron)
An ion with a negative charge is called an **anion** (Gaining an electron)

> [!TIP]
> In general, metal atoms tend to lose electrons to form cations and nonmetal atoms tend to gain electrons to form anions. Thus, ionic compounds tend to be composed of metals bonded with nonmetals, as in NaCl

In addition to simple ions like that there are also certain **polyatomic ions** which are compounds with a net nonzero charge. In other words they are ions that are not just composed of one atom

# Predicting Ionic Charges
Many atoms gain or lose electrons to end up with the same number of electrons as the noble gas closest to them in the periodic table. Noble-gas elements are chemically non reactive and form very few compounds. We might deduce that this is because their electron arrangements are very stable. Nearby elements can obtain these same stable arrangements by losing or gaining electrons. For example, the loss of one electron from an atom of sodium leaves it with the same number of electrons as in a neon atom (10). Similarly, when chlorine gains an electron, it ends up with 18, the same number of electrons as in argon

# Ionic Compounds
Sodium chloride, which we know better as common table salt ($NaCl$), is an example of an **ionic compound**, a compound made up of cations and anions
Ionic compounds are compounds made by the attraction forces between anions and cations
In this case Na is a cation and Cl is a anion
The ions in ionic compounds are arranged in three-dimensional structures as shown

Because there is no discrete molecules for this structure we use the empirical formula, this is true for most ionic compounds
