The system used to name substances is called **chemical nomenclature**
There are more than 50 million known chemical substances. Naming them all
would be a hopelessly complicated task if each had a name independent of all others.
Here are the rules for naming inorganic compounds

# Names and Formulas of Ionic Compounds
1. Cations
	1. Cations formed from metal ions have the same name as the metal
	2. $Na^+$ sodium ion, $Zn^{2+}$ zinc ion, $Al^{3+}$ aluminum ion
2. If a metal can form cations with different charges, the positive charge is indicated by a Roman numeral in parentheses following the name of the metal
	1. $Fe^{2+}$ iron(II) ion, $Cu^+$ copper(I) ion
	2. $Fe^{3+}$ iron(III) ion, $Cu^{2+}$ copper(II) ion
3. An older method still widely used for distinguishing between differently charged ions of a metal uses the endings -ous and -ic added to the root of the elementâ€™s Latin name
	1. $Fe^{2+}$ ferrous ion, $Cu^+$ cuprous ion
	2. $Fe^{3+}$ ferric ion, $Cu^{2+}$ cupric ion
4. Cations formed from nonmetal atoms have names that end in -ium
	1. $NH_4^+$ ammonium ion, $H_3O^+$ hydronium ion
5.
