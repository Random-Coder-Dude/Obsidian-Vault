The system used to name substances is called **chemical nomenclature**
There are more than 50 million known chemical substances. Naming them all
would be a hopelessly complicated task if each had a name independent of all others.
Here are the rules for naming inorganic compounds

# Names and Formulas of Ionic Compounds
1. Cations
	1. Cations formed from metal ions have the same name as the metal
		1. $Na^+$ sodium ion, $Zn^{2+}$ zinc ion, $Al^{3+}$ aluminum ion
	2. If a metal can form cations with different charges, the positive charge is indicated by a Roman numeral in parentheses following the name of the metal
		1. $Fe^{2+}$ iron(II) ion, $Cu^+$ copper(I) ion
		2. $Fe^{3+}$ iron(III) ion, $Cu^{2+}$ copper(II) ion
	3. An older method still widely used for distinguishing between differently charged ions of a metal uses the endings -ous and -ic added to the root of the elementâ€™s Latin name
		1. $Fe^{2+}$ ferrous ion, $Cu^+$ cuprous ion
		2. $Fe^{3+}$ ferric ion, $Cu^{2+}$ cupric ion
	4. Cations formed from nonmetal atoms have names that end in -ium
		1. $NH_4^+$ ammonium ion, $H_3O^+$ hydronium ion
2. Anions
	1. The names of monatomic anions are formed by replacing the ending of the name of the element with -ide
		1. $H^-$ hydride ion, $O^{2-}$ oxide ion, $N^{3-}$ nitride ion
	2. Polyatomic anions containing oxygen have names ending in either -ate or -ite and are called **oxyanions**. The -ate is used for the most common or representative oxyanion of an element, and -ite is used for an oxyanion that has the same charge but one O atom fewer
		1. $NO_3^-$ nitrate ion, $SO_4^{2-}$ sulfate ion
		2.  $NO_2^-$ nitrite ion, $SO_3^{2-}$ sulfite ion
		3. Also when the series of oxyanions increase to four members as with the halogens we get this
		4. ![[Pasted image 20250731073030.png]]
	3. Anions derived by adding to an oxyanion are named by adding as a prefix the word hydrogen or dihydrogen, as appropriate
		1. $CO_3^{2-}$ carbonate ion, $PO_4^{3-}$ phosphate ion
		2. $HCO_3^{2-}$ hydrogen carbonate ion, $H_2PO_4^{3-}$ dihydrogen phosphate ion
**To name the resulting ionic compound you combine the names of the ions with the cation then anion name**
Worked example:
Name $FeCl_3$ 
First we notice that Fe is the cation in this ionic bond and so we write
iron(*still don't know the charge*) ion
Then we look at the $Cl_3$ and we notice it contains three chloride ions which are $Cl^-$
To balance the charges the iron atom must have a charge of 3+ in order to balance the 3- of the chlorine so we know the compound must be named
**iron(III) chloride**

# Names and Formulas of Acids
An **acid** is a substance whose molecules yield hydrogen ions when dissolved in water
Some acids include $HCl$ and $H_2SO_4$ 
An acid is composed of an anion connected to enough $H^+$ ions to balance the charge
The rules are a follows
1. Acids containing anions whose names end in -ide are named by changing the -ide ending to -ic, adding the prefix hydro- to this anion name, and then following with the word acid
	1. $\ce{Cl^-\text{(chloride)}->HCl\text{(hydrochloric acid)}}$ 
	2. $\ce{S^{2-}\text{(sulfide)}->H_2S\text{(hydrosulfuric acid)}}$
2. Acids containing anions whose names end in -ate or -ite are named by changing -ate to -ic and -ite to -ous and then adding the word acid. Prefixes in the anion name are retained in the name of the acid
	1. $\ce{ClO_4^{-}\text{(perchlorate)}->HClO_4\text{(perchloric acid)}}$
	2. $\ce{ClO_3^{-}\text{(chlorate)}->HClO_3\text{(chloric acid)}}$
	3. $\ce{ClO_2^{-}\text{(chlorite)}->HClO_2\text{(chlorous acid)}}$
	4. $\ce{ClO^{-}\text{(hypochlorite)}->HClO\text{(hypochlorous acid)}}$
Worked example:
Name the acid $H_2SO_4$
Because $SO_4^{2-}$ is a sulfur oxyanion and is the most common it would be a sulfate ion
With that we can name the acid **sulfuric acid**
