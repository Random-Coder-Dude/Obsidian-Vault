The system used to name substances is called **chemical nomenclature**
There are more than 50 million known chemical substances. Naming them all
would be a hopelessly complicated task if each had a name independent of all others.
Here are the rules for naming inorganic compounds

# Names and Formulas of Ionic Compounds
1. Cations
	1. Cations formed from metal ions have the same name as the metal
		1. $Na^+$ sodium ion, $Zn^{2+}$ zinc ion, $Al^{3+}$ aluminum ion
	2. If a metal can form cations with different charges, the positive charge is indicated by a Roman numeral in parentheses following the name of the metal
		1. $Fe^{2+}$ iron(II) ion, $Cu^+$ copper(I) ion
		2. $Fe^{3+}$ iron(III) ion, $Cu^{2+}$ copper(II) ion
	3. An older method still widely used for distinguishing between differently charged ions of a metal uses the endings -ous and -ic added to the root of the elementâ€™s Latin name
		1. $Fe^{2+}$ ferrous ion, $Cu^+$ cuprous ion
		2. $Fe^{3+}$ ferric ion, $Cu^{2+}$ cupric ion
	4. Cations formed from nonmetal atoms have names that end in -ium
		1. $NH_4^+$ ammonium ion, $H_3O^+$ hydronium ion
2. Anions
	1. The names of monatomic anions are formed by replacing the ending of the name of the element with -ide
		1. $H^-$ hydride ion, $O^{2-}$ oxide ion, $N^{3-}$ nitride ion
	2. Polyatomic anions containing oxygen have names ending in either -ate or -ite and are called **oxyanions**. The -ate is used for the most common or representative oxyanion of an element, and -ite is used for an oxyanion that has the same charge but one O atom fewer
		1. $NO_3^-$ nitrate ion, $SO_4
