The study of compounds of carbon is called **organic chemistry** 
Compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen, often in combination with oxygen, nitrogen, or other elements, are called **organic compounds**

# Alkanes
Compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen are called **hydrocarbons**. In the
simplest class of hydrocarbons, **alkanes**, each carbon is bonded to four other atoms
the three smallest alkanes are methane ($CH_4$), ethane ($C_2H_6$), and propane ($C_3H_8$)
These alkanes are named by adding a -ane prefix to either the defined name (first four) or the prefixes (five or more carbons). For example there is octane ($C_8H_{18}$)
