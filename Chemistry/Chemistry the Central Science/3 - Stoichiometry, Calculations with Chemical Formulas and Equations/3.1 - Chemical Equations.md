**Stoichiometry** is the area of study that examines the quantities of substances consumed and produced in chemical reactions
Stoichiometry provides an essential set of tools widely used in chemistry
We represent chemical reactions by **chemical equations**. They are written as such $$\ce{2H_2 +O_2 -> 2H_2O}$$
The chemical formulas to the left of the arrow represent the starting substances, called **reactants**
The chemical formulas to the right of the arrow represent substances produced in the reaction, called **products**
Because atoms are neither created nor destroyed in any reaction, a chemical equation must have an equal number of atoms of each element on each side of the arrow. When this condition is met, the equation is balanced.

# Balancing Equations
Once we know the formulas of the reactants and products in a reaction, we can write
an unbalanced equation
Then we can balance it by adding coefficients
In most cases a balanced equation should contain the smallest whole number coefficients possible
Worked example:
balance the equation $\ce{CH_4 + O_2 -> CO_2 + H_2O}$
First lets balance hydrogen there are four in the reactants and 2 in the products so that means $H_2O$ will need double the coefficient of $CH_4$ 
Then balancing the carbon we find that $CH_4$ and $CO_2$ require the same coefficient
so now we have $\ce{xCH_4 + O_2 -> xCO_2 + 2xH_2O}$
if $x=1$ then all we need to do to balance the equation is put a coefficient of 2 in front of the $O_2$ and we get the balanced equation $\ce{CH_4 + 2O_2 -> CO_2 + 2H_2O}$

# Indicating the States of Reactants and Products
We use the symbols (g), (l), (s), and (aq) for gas, liquid, solid, and aqueous (water) solution, respectively
So the equation can be written as $\ce{CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) -> CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(g)}$
Sometimes the conditions under which the reaction proceeds appear above or below
the reaction arrow. The symbol $\Delta$ (Greek uppercase delta) above the arrow indicates
addition of heat.
