**Stoichiometry** is the area of study that examines the quantities of substances consumed and produced in chemical reactions
Stoichiometry provides an essential set of tools widely used in chemistry
We represent chemical reactions by **chemical equations**. They are written as such $$\ce{2H_2 +O_2 -> 2H_2O}$$
The chemical formulas to the left of the arrow represent the starting substances, called **reactants**
The chemical formulas to the right of the arrow represent substances produced in the reaction, called **products**
Because atoms are neither created nor destroyed in any reaction, a chemical equation must have an equal number of atoms of each element on each side of the arrow. When this condition is met, the equation is balanced.

# Balancing Equations
Once we know the formulas of the reactants and products in a reaction, we can write
an unbalanced equation
Then we can balance it by adding coefficents
In most cases a balanced equation should contain
