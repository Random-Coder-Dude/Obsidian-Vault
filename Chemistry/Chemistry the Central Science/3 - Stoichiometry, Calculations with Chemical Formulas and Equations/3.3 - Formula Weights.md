# Formula and Molecular Weights
The **formula weight** of a substance is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms in the chemical formula of the substance
For example the formula weight of sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$) is 98.1 amu
The formula weight of a element is equal to its atomic weight. Also the formula weight is sometimes called the **molecular weight**
Because ionic substances exist as 3 dimensional arrays of atoms we instead speak of a formula unit. However in practice it is the same process as other compounds
