# Formula and Molecular Weights
The **formula weight** of a substance is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms in the chemical formula of the substance
For example the formula weight of sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$) is 98.1 amu
The formula weight of a element is equal to its atomic weight. Also the formula weight is sometimes called the **molecular weight**
Because ionic substances exist as 3 dimensional arrays of atoms we instead speak of a formula unit. However in practice it is the same process as other compounds

# Percentage Composition from Chemical Formulas
**Percentage composition** of a compound that is, the percentage by mass contributed by each element in the substance
It is calculated by $$\text{\% composition of element}=\frac{(\text{number of atoms of element})(\text{atomic weight of element})}{\text{formula weight of substance}}\times100\%$$
