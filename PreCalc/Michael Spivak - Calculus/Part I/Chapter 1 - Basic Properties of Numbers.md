This chapter will lay out 12 different properties of numbers. The first 9 are concerned with the fundamental operations of addition and multiplication

All properties will be written in this format

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 1. if *a*, *b*, and *c* are any numbers, then$$a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$$

This statement clearly shows there is no difference between the sum of two numbers and three numbers

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 2. if *a* is any number, then$$a+0=0+a=a$$

This statement shows that 0 does not change the value of *a* when they are summed together

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 3. for every number *a*, there is a number *-a* such that$$a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0$$
> 

While these properties might feel self explanatory they are there to create a solid foundation mathematicians can build off of
