This chapter will lay out 12 different properties of numbers. The first 9 are concerned with the fundamental operations of addition and multiplication

All properties will be written in this format

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 1. if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are any numbers, then$$a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$$

This statement clearly shows there is no difference between the sum of two numbers and three numbers

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 2. if $a$ is any number, then$$a+0=0+a=a$$

This statement shows that 0 does not change the value of *a* when they are summed together

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 3. for every number $a$, there is a number $-a$ such that$$a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0$$
> 

While these properties might feel self explanatory they are there to create a solid foundation mathematicians can build off of

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 4. if $a$ and $b$ are any numbers, then$$a+b=b+a$$

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 5. if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are any numbers, then$$a\cdot(b\cdot c)=(a\cdot b)\cdot c$$

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 6. if $a$ is any number, then$$a\cdot1=1\cdot a=a$$
> Moreover, $1\neq0$

> [!NOTE] Theory
> 7. for every number $a\neq0$, there is a number $a^{-1}$ such that$$a\cdot a^{-1}=a^{-1}\cdot a=1$$
