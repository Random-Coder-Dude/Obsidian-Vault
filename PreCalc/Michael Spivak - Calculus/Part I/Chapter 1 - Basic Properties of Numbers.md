This chapter will lay out 12 different properties of numbers. The first 9 are concerned with the fundamental operations of addition and multiplication

All properties will be written in this format

> [!Theory]
> 1. if *a*, *b*, and *c* are any numbers, then$$a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$$

This statement clearly shows there is no difference between the sum of two numbers and three numbers

> [!Theory]
> 2. if *a* is any number, then$$a+0=0+a=a$$
